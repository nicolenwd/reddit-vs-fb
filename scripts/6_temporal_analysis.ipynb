    "Plotting the change in sentiment scores over time gives better insight into why there is no statistically significant difference between the mean polarity score of Facebook and Reddit comments. For both VADER and TextBlob scoring, we see that while Reddit comments are more negative than Facebook comments initially sometime in May-June 2021, Reddit comments are substantially more positive than Facebook comments in Sep-Oct 2021. To understand these patterns, I will look closer at the articles and the corresponding comments at 3 points when the gap in scores across platform was biggest: 18 May 2021, 12 Sep 2021 and 30 Sep 2021"

When they eat or during routine time, their masks are off and they’d definitely talk to each other.  Many preschoolers have older siblings in primary or secondary school. I’m very worried that there’d be an outbreak in preschools coz can you imagine what these kiddos will be going through?  Please don’t wait until the bomb go jibaboom le then react.

       "2789  Honestly, preschools should be closed as well. Childcare and studentcare to be open for parents who can’t Work From Home. These young ones are told that they can’t sing songs and play together with others... have you interacted with kids below 6yo? 🤦🏻‍♀️  Most childcare centres are pretty small. When they eat or during routine time, their masks are off and they’d definitely talk to each other.  Many preschoolers have older siblings in primary or secondary school. I’m very worried that there’d be an outbreak in preschools coz can you imagine what these kiddos will be going through?  Please don’t wait until the bomb go jibaboom le then react. Like what these politicians have been doing. The older kids are suffering because of these politicians man 😢   \n",

Most of 'em aren't even in it for the cause; they're in it because it feels good to be relevant or that certain causes are now hip and trending. \"LOOK AT **ME**, I'M SO VIRTUOUS\". It's a disservice to the actual victims.  And let's not forget that there were already some pulling up comparisons to apartheid and segregation when the different restrictions for vaccinated and unvaccinated people kicked in. Calling for the segregation of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in nursing homes and other high-risk places (it's a good idea, by the way) is gonna bring these SJW tossjobs screeching out of the woodworks again.   \n",

For an elderly and immunocompromis ed 70 and above person, the question is whether it is worth it to get a vaccination or let nature takes its course. Unless that person is totally isolated, once exposed to an infected caretaker or family member, he or she will be ravished by the virus when it passes through. If the vaccines are very very safe for normal elderly persons, then rationally, it is better to get a vaccination.  But this responsibility cannot be passed to doctors to do the persuasion. Only immediate family members can come to a common decision as what is best to recommend for those elderly who depend on them for their needs.</td>\n",

       "5123  This is a hard decision for family members to take.  For an elderly and immunocompromis ed 70 and above person, the question is whether it is worth it to get a vaccination or let nature takes its course. Unless that person is totally isolated, once exposed to an infected caretaker or family member, he or she will be ravished by the virus when it passes through. If the vaccines are very very safe for normal elderly persons, then rationally, it is better to get a vaccination.  But this responsibility cannot be passed to doctors to do the persuasion. Only immediate family members can come to a common decision as what is best to recommend for those elderly who depend on them for their needs.   \n",

       "7888  My wife and I had a huge dilemma of whether to keep our 2 year old in school. He loves school, and he's learning a lot too. But with the rising cases and instances of pre-school clusters we decided to stop sending him there. It's a very heartbreaking decision because he's already spending the bulk of his existence barely interacting with others, but we also don't want to have to swap a toddler everyday if he does catches it, on top of us as parents having our own professional life rudely disrupted.   \n",

Every lockdown and every restrictions is a difficult decision for them to implement. And the how to reopen is determined by how likely the reopen decision will result in another lockdown.  So, it is never in their favour to lockdown forever. They might get you to TraceForever, SwabForever, and TestForever, but never LockdownForever. Simply is not in their interest.  The rest of the world has moved on, leaving us and few other countries behind. The government will be eager to catch up with the rest of the world. Now they are struggling to decide whether to sacrifice a few lives for Singapore to catch up with them.  I'm pretty confident they will eventually decide to sacrifices a few lives, let them die for the betterment of the country and businesses. They have another 2 to 3 years to do damage control for their political reputation. So no worries for them.  My inference is based on common sense and my understanding of the government (read more books). I don't have a crystal ball to give you an exact date on when you can return to school.

       "7924  Let's just believe that a lockdown hurts their pockets. The Singapore government are known to be very pro-business. Every lockdown and every restrictions is a difficult decision for them to implement. And the how to reopen is determined by how likely the reopen decision will result in another lockdown.  So, it is never in their favour to lockdown forever. They might get you to TraceForever, SwabForever, and TestForever, but never LockdownForever. Simply is not in their interest.  The rest of the world has moved on, leaving us and few other countries behind. The government will be eager to catch up with the rest of the world. Now they are struggling to decide whether to sacrifice a few lives for Singapore to catch up with them.  I'm pretty confident they will eventually decide to sacrifices a few lives, let them die for the betterment of the country and businesses. They have another 2 to 3 years to do damage control for their political reputation. So no worries for them.  My inference is based on common sense and my understanding of the government (read more books). I don't have a crystal ball to give you an exact date on when you can return to school. But I have high confidences that you won't have to lock yourself in your room for long.   \n",

Gym closed   2. Library closed/restricted 3. Discussion rooms with limited people 4. A chance for the school to kick you out of your accommodation/provide no accomodation  and now this recent news to have no access to school wifi for NUS students + yale-nus discontinued news, i just wanna say with Ministry of Health's incompetence with this years covid situation, higher ups in our universities that handle covid decision-making also takes the cake for the most wtf-is-this measure making from a student's pov.   \n",

For SIM there's almost really no face 2 face interactions at all. I've not met anyone in university for the last 1 year except when there were 1-2 group projects. I wish I could connect with more people, but for the greater good this is part of the norm now.   \n",
