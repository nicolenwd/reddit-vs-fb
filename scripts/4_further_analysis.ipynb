    "Plotting the change in sentiment scores over time gives better insight into why there is no statistically significant difference between the mean polarity score of Facebook and Reddit comments. For both VADER and TextBlob scoring, we see that while Reddit comments are more negative than Facebook comments initially sometime in May-June 2021, Reddit comments are substantially more positive than Facebook comments in Sep-Oct 2021. To understand these patterns, I will look closer at the articles and the corresponding comments in May 2021 at 3 points when the gap in scores across platform was biggest:\n",

These young ones are told that they can’t sing songs and play together with others... have you interacted with kids below 6yo? 🤦🏻‍♀️  Most childcare centres are pretty small. When they eat or during routine time, their masks are off and they’d definitely talk to each other.  Many preschoolers have older siblings in primary or secondary school. I’m very worried that there’d be an outbreak in preschools coz can you imagine what these kiddos will be going through?  Please don’t wait until the bomb go jibaboom le then react.

       "2789  Honestly, preschools should be closed as well. Childcare and studentcare to be open for parents who can’t Work From Home. These young ones are told that they can’t sing songs and play together with others... have you interacted with kids below 6yo? 🤦🏻‍♀️  Most childcare centres are pretty small. When they eat or during routine time, their masks are off and they’d definitely talk to each other.  Many preschoolers have older siblings in primary or secondary school. I’m very worried that there’d be an outbreak in preschools coz can you imagine what these kiddos will be going through?  Please don’t wait until the bomb go jibaboom le then react. Like what these politicians have been doing. The older kids are suffering because of these politicians man 😢   \n",

Most of 'em aren't even in it for the cause; they're in it because it feels good to be relevant or that certain causes are now hip and trending. \"LOOK AT **ME**, I'M SO VIRTUOUS\". It's a disservice to the actual victims.  And let's not forget that there were already some pulling up comparisons to apartheid and segregation when the different restrictions for vaccinated and unvaccinated people kicked in. Calling for the segregation of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in nursing homes and other high-risk places (it's a good idea, by the way) is gonna bring these SJW tossjobs screeching out of the woodworks again.   \n",
