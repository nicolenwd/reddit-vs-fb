1,gww5jfz,"&gt; This means people will no longer be allowed to digitally check in by scanning a venue's SafeEntry QR code with their phone camera or the Singpass app from May 17. Scanning of barcodes on personal identification cards to check in to venues will still be allowed until May 31.

Important to take note!!"
2,gww68ne,phase 2 lai liao wah shag
3,gww6icr,"Government fucks up and takes it out on the population again. No changes for workplaces obviously, but everyone else gets fucked. 

Everyone who said during raya last year “lock down this year to celebrate next year” was a fucking liar. 

Fuck this shit"
4,gww6luf,Gyms also closed till 30th. PepeHands. I just want to rock climb ;_;
5,gww6q6n,Got wfh leh
6,gww6qjd,Oh for fucks sake
7,gww6rut,"They can make rules, but I really wonder how many are going to follow. So many people with pandemic fatigue"
8,gww6t8s,Does this include outdoor swimming pools?
9,gww6tnz,"&gt;No changes for workplaces obviously

""Under the new rules, no more than 50 per cent of employees who are able  to work from home should be in the office at any one time, down from 75  per cent at present."""
10,gww6u95,Hmm? 75 to 50% is a change no?
11,gww6v0a,Bye bye gains
12,gww6vr4,"Fuck the SG government. They haven’t come up with a workable solution to the borders, or to wfh. We pay the price with restrictions to our social lives. 

Whilst countries like aus and New Zealand get to enjoy life restriction free, and those in the EU, UK and US have positive roadmaps in place for exiting Covid, we get stuck with an inept group of politicians who can’t get a fucking grip on what they’re trying to achieve."
14,gww71z4,"Of course this was going to happen. All it needed was *one* person to slip through the cracks and the authorities would be scrambling to chase its tail. Just one guy can press the reset button on all the work we’ve done since Jan 2020. 

Mostly annoyed because *everyone* saw this coming with how we were constantly importing cases, even through the period when we had zero community cases for months. 

I don’t claim to have perfect information, but I just cannot understand why we couldn’t block travel for a while. In the end, for whatever pros of letting them in, it is us locals who bear the cost and suffering.

Really man, vomit blood sometimes. Why we gotta be so reactive to shit we commonfolk can see coming from a mile away. Can die sia."
15,gww75jf,"This!!

Only either the TT token or the TT app will be accepted after 17 May."
16,gww76cu,"They keep allowing imports from high risk areas and now with this mess, the obedient citizen has to pay for price and here the government told everyone to remind vigilant and they are the one underestimate the situation."
17,gww7bk2,Lol jumping on the hate bandwagon without even reading the news properly.
18,gww7bpv,"ok honestly fuck off sia how come this shit keeps happening during my batch's holidays, cb later got CB round 2 also toh laaa"
19,gww7c37,"Amazing 4G leadership! Please call for an elections again this year because I am very sure a lot of people will wanna vote for you all and give you the well deserving mandate! 

So proud to have smart leaders like you all!!!"
21,gww7gea,"would you rather pay the price with the lives of your loved ones? thats what those in the EU, UK and US did."
22,gww7hc7,Who gave this comment gold lol. Workplaces got affected too or did you only read the article title
23,gww7ho8,travel bubble moment
24,gww7ipo,"when the first was first report: ""oh, wait and see, then take action.""
when the first few migrant workers were infected: ""oh, wait and see, then take action.""
when the virus in a particular country just kept spreading: ""oh, wait and see, then take action.""

all because they wanted to take the risk and lapse their judgement. economy first, eh?"
25,gww7iqt,"Really don't make sense. Why they allow people to anyhow fly in and out during a pandemic? It's no longer essential business travel. One of the cases is an Indian national here to visit relatives dafug??

edit: [PAP IB working OT today](https://i.redd.it/0nay7gagp3x61.jpg). u/stoicwarrior2 why resort to private message?"
26,gww7kpn,50% capacity is hardly a change. Where I work it’s been less than that anyway.
27,gww7l3s,Revert back to 50% wfh la
28,gww7lkc,"Man I really hope it doesn't affect my coming interview this week, this sucks man"
29,gww7ll3,Fuck offffffffff
30,gww7luz,Simple solution. Make WFH permanent
31,gww7mqm,It's almost like they were extra careful not to fuck up CNY then bochup when it came to Hari Raya
32,gww7mrg,"Sian, when will this ever end? Why are we e ones always getting the blame and paying the price for their incompetency and their half baked measures?"
33,gww7nm2,We were repeatedly told to be vigilant while they relax on country entry.
34,gww7sws,Import more lah you clowns. We had this under control and for what? Everything is becoming undone now.
35,gww7t1y,"if only singapore bothered to kept its borders *completely shut until vaccination herd immunity* (like how new zealand did) instead of wasting time pursuing *unilateral* openings and travel bubbles

singapore chose to gamble with covid risk, and it lost its bet. that risk management approach ended up burning their fingers. see lah"
36,gww7t4o,"Cause you have Singaporeans and prs coming back along with workers needed for constructive, domestic helpers etc. It's not leisure travel"
37,gww7uo9,"came in here just to look at the emotional outbursts by people lol. outburst first then think later.

there really is no winning. tighten you get yelled at, dont tighten you get yelled at."
38,gww7upz,"hahahaha i just started a habit to gym nearly everyday even if its just a bit now closed aaaaaaa

help lah :("
39,gww7w4d,"""lets import people from countries where covid19 is out of control what could possibly go wrong 🤔"""
40,gww7x4v,"Australia: I will jail my citizens for coming back home and ban my citizens from even going overseas (even for compassionate reasons)

EU: You sure they have positive roadmap when their vaccination is a huge mess??"
41,gww7xhp,Feels like we’re being punished for the G’s mistakes lol
42,gww81hd,At least I have somewhat of a home gym
43,gww81x2,Climb outdoor. Hahahaha
44,gww83ph,"The amount of lead time to 8 May is just ridiculous, haven’t we learned that Singaporeans overreact and overcompensate when given lead time? Expect gyms to be a clusterfuck from now till Saturday."
45,gww84lq,Bruh
46,gww8772,CB1.5
47,gww88b9,Thanks India
48,gww88ud,"This is fine.

I dont mind going down to 5 people social groups, i am lonely anyway.

I dont mind the government infringing on my rights by forcing us to use tracetogether when all other methods are viable because we are doing our part to help prevent COVID-19 from spreading to our community when our own government arent doing it anyway. 

I dont mind rolling back to 50% maximum occupancy for all workplaces, since it is obvious my boss will just ignore all rules and have anyone back on site.

I certainly dont mind not going to gyms anymore since i only live on work and nothing else as well. Why exercise when you can work?

I certainly dont mind sticking to the rules now as mentioned by our future PM, Mr Lawrence Wong, since THEY took such a long time to restrict travel from India and THEY want us to abide by the rules NOW.

This is fine. This is absolutely fine."
49,gww89rc,Decathlon: stonks
51,gww8cvj,wonder if there’ll be panic buying lol
52,gww8edu,I genuinely don't see the reasoning behind reducing the number of home visitors from 8-&gt;5 unless they're expecting cases to rise drastically.
53,gww8em9,leadership is like shit. Everything got new restrictions. Didn't even get rid of the ones from before CNY even though we went back to 0-1 average the last few mths
54,gww8g1a,its sad how we have to go back to this state again. we had it under control man.
55,gww8hjy,Here we go again hais
57,gww8itk,"Siao liao. CB 2.0 coming liao 😱😱😱

&gt;SINGAPORE - Rules on social gatherings will be tightened starting this Saturday (May 8), as Singapore takes stricter measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 in the wider community. 

If it's urgent why not make it ASAP?"
58,gww8j1k,"*""we have to go back""* /s"
59,gww8jdt,"Just the government panicking and flailing. We are well past the point of ""sensible, measured policy""."
60,gww8jhn,"No blame culture please, let's adhere to the guidelines and tide this through"
61,gww8lim,"And Australia and New Zealand both stopped that, and they are all living near normal lives."
62,gww8mdp,"Don’t use logic against the outrage. The prevailing narrative is ‘boo pap allow ppl to come in for economy’, ignoring the fact people have been increasingly complacent."
63,gww8mea,Please also give credit to the Singapore government :))
64,gww8mhl,"Lawrence wong become PM, singapore is dead."
65,gww8msx,"Going back into phase 2 with majority of the older population already vaccinated. 5 community cases and these geniuses think its a good idea to 'protect' everyone from a disease which has proved to be non-lethal with most of its victims being asymptomatic. This disease will never go away completely, hell, there are probably more people developing fevers each day than contracting covid. Having the vaccination drive would probably prove to be useless in the end. This government would probably still come to this decision even if &gt;0.5 of the population was vaccinated."
66,gww8ngp,"Are you really expecting most Singaporeans, who have been following all the measures, to not be unhappy in having to face more restrictions when they're not responsible for the increase in cases?

I don't see the current situation warranty reducing social group sizes when that's not remotely close to being the main driver of new infections. Even at one of NZ's higher alerts (level 3), they're still allowing for groups of up to 10."
67,gww8o6e,Rip my June holiday plans
68,gww8oqy,Same here. Just joined a gym too. Fml.
69,gww8q44,continuous phase 2.5
70,gww8r0z,The construction workers explanation is not very sound. We’ve seen how badly hit a dormitory can be and we are going to allow workers from India to come in with a highly infectious variant? Feels like taking one step forward and ten steps behind.
71,gww8s6w,"""Not a circuit breaker"".

The term for 2021 is ""measures""."
72,gww8tdb,Ugh fuck if they didn't lie and backtrack on the privacy concerns and tracing data I wouldn't be as reluctant and concerned about downloading the app or getting the physical token
73,gww8u4j,"Most of the cases have foreign strains, but somehow its our fault again 🤡"
74,gww8ub6,Appropriate avatar
75,gww8y7n,I’m glad we have time to adjust at work. Hated the previous practice of these evening announcements that took effect immediately. Now I can chill and sort it tomorrow.
76,gww8ysz,where do you think most construction workers come from
77,gww926k,It's just so reactionary. Even New Zealand's second highest alert (level 3) allows for up to 10 per group.
78,gww92l1,Brave soul
79,gww9433,it's fucking wayang
80,gww94e0,Delays in BTO cos no workers. Resale flat prices will increase.
81,gww95rx,Our gov't is super kiasee about everything. got no balls politically speaking
82,gww9606,To the moon 🚀🚀🚀
83,gww96dl,"This has lesser to do with the fact that people are coming in and more with the fact that India had 100k+ daily cases and mr lawrence Wong’s amazing statement was that we cannot afford to close the borders to them.

Now we have local cases again AND we have to close the borders to them. Complacent or not with 0 community cases it won’t trigger a new cluster if we’re not consciously importing cases from active countries.

How people still can twist this and say we caused it really explains why the ruling party can still comfortably stay in power. Delusion at its highest."
84,gww97ag,It’s now quicker than Singapore’s. Have a look at the German vaccination rates for example.
85,gww97md,"its like the government doesn't give a solitary shit and just throws a dart at a dartboard about what to close. no social distancing on MRT, buses, and advise that most of population should be back to work LOL. 

they keep the borders open, now the indian variant is here. 

actually, lets punish the sinkies because they didn't download our gov app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
86,gww98lc,Dorscon orange gao is here?
88,gww9bnz,it literally started from an ICA checkpoint with an india variant and now they punish the locals lmfao. ridiculous. how can they sleep at night?
89,gww9c6e,Never understood why people keep making a big deal of his handling of the situation tbh. Said as much in other threads. Just because he cried in parliament means he cares?
90,gww9cv1,"Option A: Reduce future supply of new buildings by doing whatever work with a relatively healthy group of existing workers

Option B: Import workers from a country that we know has a super high infection rate and let them be housed together with the workers we already have

If construction is so important to you, you do realise it is highly likely we end up with less healthy workers than if we had closed the borders?"
91,gww9dim,Fuck u PAP for closing gyms
92,gww9e8f,"From another article, looks like no, but capacity will be decreased

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/gyms-and-other-higher-risk-settings-to-be-closed-size-limits-on-large-events"
93,gww9emx,"To be fair, the EU and US  have a roadmap out because of vaccination, not control of the spread. Even the UK 'success' is still having 1k+ cases per day, and the US is number 2 in the world in infections. I don't think having that degree of transmission is acceptable, and government looks like they want to limit local spread to single digits.

 Singapore is still easily best in east asia in terms of vaccines per capita. All the healthcare workers and grandparents are safe, so our most vulnerable groups are protected. Fingers crossed, but when vaccinations open to everyone in June/July, opening up will come shortly after. No matter what we do, covid will never go away because it can spread without symptoms. The only way is to reach herd immunity and make it no worse than seasonal flu."
94,gww9fbn,"Nintendo Switch, Ring Fit prices 🚀🌕"
95,gww9fv9,So true
96,gww9g1j,"I dont buy into the govt’s narrative about having open borders = more economic growth. If the country were to get overwhelmed by virus, local SMEs would suffer the most in a lockdown. For now only the fitness industry suffers but I have a few friends there who will not have income for this month, especially since alot of these people work on a freelance basis. If more industries have to lockdown, what was the point of having open borders?"
97,gww9gib,"&amp;#x200B;

I never said that. I just said there is no winning. What is the alternative here? We keep status quo and we gamble on the current cases dying out. You should look at some of the other government bashing treads where scores of people were asking for tighter measures throughout the past week, flash lockdowns etc. I get why people are unhappy and can empathize but my god - for people who always complain that the government is too reactive, they can be very reactive bunches themselves. I mean just look at this tread, some people never even bothered reading the article before posting an outburst!

As with everything there has to be a balanced approach. I'm not going to sit here and defend the government completely because there were things they could have done better. But suggesting that Singapore's borders should have been completely closed from last year to now...really? Please tell that to the scores of people who have lost their jobs, livelihoods etc and their loved ones whose lives have been impacted negatively.

Thank you for the calm demeanour and composed question though."
99,gww9id3,i think sgeans a bit too guai. Just accept everything gov't throws at them
100,gww9in7,"wtf LOL. singapore has one of the strictest mask mandates in the world. this is absolutely the fault of the immigration policy and if you deny that then you're delusional. like, the whole situation started at an ICA checkpoint lmfao"
101,gww9iym,I think alot of gyms are by booking system now ah so it probably wouldn't be much different
102,gww9k1f,Currently gyms already have queue systems to prevent entry once capacity is reached. So this is false. Users in the gym will remain the same but you may experience longer queues or more competition for the same number of slots.
103,gww9ku8,why are singaporeans and PRs even overseas during a pandemic???
104,gww9l62,Eh they have to shn before being released to the dorms for work just FYI
105,gww9m1z,Its rewind time
106,gww9me7,"Singaporeans and PRs fair enough.

But the bulk of imported cases was from India and other countries wasn’t it? Furthermore, why were Indians exempt from 14 day quarantine? They’re statistically the highest risk profile of cases; this isn’t a question of capability and intelligence, it’s simply an issue of ignorance and arrogance!

 “Aiyah won’t happen one lah just let them come in how bad can it be?”  10 bucks that’s what was said at the meeting. Because if they were even *a bit* kiasu, they would have done things differently.

And come on lah. Construction? Your buildings got so important to complete until have to risk a cluster meh. Wtf. We already have excess migrant labour workers here in the dorms, have to import more? Backside lah. Even stupider if we have to import for economy and business - just adapt, compromise, and fucking use zoom."
107,gww9miv,"Well, LW did address that during his press conference. Something about “we cannot afford to…..ah, never mind. You should know it by now."
108,gww9mww,More that he's the front of the MTF
109,gww9nac,"Idk but it isn't really uncalled for, we've been importing cases, everyone saw it coming with the new strain, the stupidest fucking thing, is that most ppl have been following guidelines for a while, and now it feels like us common peasants are paying for the government mistake. 

Its just a bit frustrating to see us trying our best with restrictions, and yet we still can't get back to normal. I really think its the fact that we've been doing this for almost a year and it feels like we're taking 2 steps back after 1 step forward, people can tahan but only for so long..."
110,gww9nrb,"Yall better remember who NOT to vote for in 2025, fuckkkkkk"
111,gww9o1l,It’s stupid. Apparently it’s so bad they need to close down for 3 weeks.... but we’ll wait 4 days to enforce it? Makes no sense
112,gww9qog,"Bus and mrt. Cluster f until dont know like what. 

These rules make no sense."
113,gww9qqf,"When they need to wayang, the tears come out. I remember when LHL crying in 2011 when he realized he could be the first PM to lose a GRC. His quote 

&gt; “If we didn’t quite get it right, I am sorry but we will try and do better the next time,”   
&gt;  
&gt;""Well, we’re sorry we didn’t get it exactly right, but I hope you’ll  understand and bear with us because we’re trying our best to fix the  problems.” 

Then let's not forget Jo Teo's award winning performance in parliament while refusing to apologize to foreign workers for the dorm spread."
114,gww9ufd,ahhahahah vote for pap huat ah
115,gww9uxp,"Okay, who's going to pay for the delays in the contracted construction work? Are we okay with our gov't paying upfront to mostly foreign companies for construction before they're done? Because they are going to demand money for their cashflow

Workers were already being quarantined for 14days before allowed to join the dorm. This is what's done even in Aus and NZ, 14 day quarantine."
116,gww9xf5,"Right, its not like COVID is gonna wait until 8 May for us to be ready then start infecting.

These systems and procedures should already be in place and it should be able to be activated at a moments notice."
117,gww9xt6,"They sleep very well in their nice houses where even with CB, they have no financial worries, they have a nice house with all available luxuries to weather the lockdown.

The families living in 2 room flats which are cramped, the parents losing their jobs? Just throw some financial aid at them but always remind them that their situation is because of their own fault. Last time never study, never work hard."
118,gww9xuh,I think what is particularly stunning was not the low number of cases per day but rather the way these cases were detected. Some of these cases were first negative on PCR only to be positive later. This may just mean that the traditional assumption of quarantine plus PCR test does not go work for a country that is so densely populated.
119,gwwa0k0,Nope. There are people coming in for leisure reasons. Like the recent Indian case who was here to visit relatives.
120,gwwa106,"It could be because when he cried, he was projecting an image of breaking away from the status quo somehow. It could very well be manufactured, but the fact remains that many Singaporeans were successfully moved by it. And if he were really moved to tears by the crisis, then that's even better--we have someone in charge of the country who genuinely cares."
121,gwwa2bv,If you don’t see how this is the fault of immigration policy you’re either a moron or a shill. There would be no virus here if they didn’t keep importing it! It has nothing to do with locals
122,gwwa3cz,"Gee thanks Gov! I clap for you! Not only you CB during Hari Raya, it happens AGAIN this year. 

C'mon lah it's your fault for not restrict earlier."
123,gwwa42t,"To effectively minimise the risk of transmission at this point of time, WFH should be a default arrangement.

This ruling of no more then 50% at the workplace is a half-hearted move."
124,gwwa4u4,Hello Phase 2 my old friend...
125,gwwa5n8,here we go again
126,gwwa6uq,"Fuck this gov. If only they divert their efforts to the real problem of border control instead of shit like TT, ban alcohol after 2230, no karaoke etc

edit: [PAP IB working OT today](https://i.redd.it/0nay7gagp3x61.jpg). u/stoicwarrior2 why resort to private message?"
127,gwwa7mr,Stop browsing r/sg and your sanity will thank you for it
128,gwwaa0x,Can’t see anything specifically mentioning outdoor pools in the article
130,gwwaark,never. govt has no plan. Virus is endemic now
131,gwwabyy,Burden sia really why the hell ppl can’t tahan for a few more months
132,gwwacqb,"Scrolling through, seems like most people were calling for tightening borders while loosening locally, which is definitely a reasonable opinion. Also, reddit isn't a collective hivemind, and different people will have different views."
133,gwwadg1,You are thinking this is the same situation we faced in 2020 and that these measures we have are sufficient. They clearly aren’t. Look at the TTSH cluster. It is a place in Singapore with the highest hygiene and social distancing standards and we can still have a cluster formed with the Indian variant.
134,gwwadvu,ah crap baskets
135,gwwag59,"Same. 

It's also funny how they all take it so personally on any mentions of us having to stay vigilant. I fail to see how that amounts to the government pinning the blame on us."
136,gwwahcf,Omg this. I really appreciate gov for controlling the pandemic but they really enforce the measures a little too late everytime like banning people from India from entering.
137,gwwahlf,Sigh. To be expected 😢
138,gwwain7,"&gt; However, outdoor organised exercise programmes may still continue, provided class sizes are limited to a maximum of 30 people and safe distancing measures are in place.

Yea I assumed from this. Maybe I'm wrong, let's wait further for more details"
139,gwwakbi,Just australia. And they are coming under heavy fire from their local populace for barring citizens from returning. Its not a popular policy apparently
140,gwwamt5,So we have the bear the consequences of someone’s else mistake?
141,gwwan8n,4 days of everyone rushing to have group outings
142,gwwaq0o,This is more like phase 1.5 tbh. Like can gather in 5 ppl but no gym
143,gwwaqup,Im like TT
144,gwwasoy,What if they forgot or didn’t bring token
145,gwwast8,Indians were never exempt from quarantine.
146,gwwatlj,Perhaps they were there before the pandemic began?
147,gwwau1s,"Because some people have families, partners, children abroad? Even many people living here, but have their family in Johor. People have personal compelling reasons to travel. No one in their right mind forks out north of $5k to travel for fun"
148,gwwau7i,"So you are saying we should totally shut off our borders.... till when? Why not go all the way then? Everyone locked in their houses till herd immunity. Isn’t that the most foolproof way of not having any spread? 

But of course no one is willing to do that; gotta queue up to gai gai at the newly opened Ikea afterall. That shit is essential af."
149,gwwavaw,"To me that just means the measures don't work and we were just deluding ourselves into thinking they were. But it doesn't stop the fact that buildings need to continue being constructed and a certain region still provides the largest number of workers in that industry that is impossible to swap out on short notice. 

At some point, if you're an adult you are going to have to weight pro and con and the various risks involved"
150,gwwave2,It’s still under control yo.
151,gwwavn5,"New Zealand does it somewhat defacto with long ass wait times.

153,gwwax4s,"Exactly my pain. I started my gym membership about 6 weeks ago and gained about 3kg (it was super hard for me to gain weight before this), and now I think I am going to lose all the gains."
154,gwwaxje,What's the obsession with rushing to close gyms every time? Has it been shown that transmission can happen more easily there? It seems like a weird scapegoat to avoid closing the (much more risky) venues that their voter base actually cares about.
156,gwwb0tq,Back to online Raya again 💁🏽
157,gwwb12u,they are SO lucky elections took place last year and not this year lmao

[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-resilience-ranking/](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-resilience-ranking/)"
165,gwwb6vd,yes. I don't fucking get the govt reaction. We had days where we had a fucking 1000+ cases last year. you telling us our hospital system now can't handle 100??
166,gwwb7a4,Well well well here we go again
167,gwwb7h5,"&gt; We keep status quo and we gamble on the current cases dying out.

Is the status quo unsustainable given current trends? Even New Zealand, in a similar situation last year, never went past Alert level 3 and allowed for groups of up to 10? Why the need to reduce it to 5 for Singapore then?

&gt;You should look at some of the other government bashing treads where scores of people were asking for tighter measures throughout the past week, flash lockdowns etc.

Could you link those threads and posts please? Given the degree of lockdown fatigue, I really doubt most Singaporeans would actually request for tighter measures.

&gt;As with everything there has to be a balanced approach.

Are the current group size limits the reason we're seeing these cases? Are gyms the reason for them? Is that balance?

&gt;Please tell that to the scores of people who have lost their jobs, livelihoods etc and their loved ones whose lives have been impacted negatively.

Tell that to the migrant workers who were already in Singapore and have been in lockdown for over a year.

Tell that to businesses that still cannot fully reopen because we're too slow to restrict travel from hotspots. If New Zealand could, why did we only react 2 weeks later than them?

Certainly there are some economic benefits to facilitating some travel but i think it’s pretty clear that the level of acceptable risk slipped too high, especially recently.

Because a) vaccines aren't 100% effective and b) not everyone is taking them. You're never going to have 100% vaccination for people in singapore, and people entering singapore. At this moment though, the elderly which have the highest risk of dying have already had their chance to take the vaccine so that's the best that can be expected instead of stopping everything in case people die.

Some use actual queues, and these can be physical or via a digital system. Digital systems allow you to go do something else and return when they notify its your turn.

These people can travel privately from the airport to the hotel and then after mere 2 days be allowed to go. One case which was publicly acknowledged (person from Brunei) was attributed to this scheme.

I was at a hotel for a staycation and I saw some Chinese visitors checking in at the same counter as me ahead of me and they had just arrived from airport. I was worried that even if there is a remote chance they have the virus (but nit detected) I would most definitely get it as I was touching the same counter, using the same lift etc.

While people coming from places like India are quarantined for 14-21 days and yet are able to stay infectious (which I actually doubt) then this 2 day quarantine scheme was a definite ticking time bomb. I personally feel that it isn’t the people who stay infectious but probably stuff they carry with them as luggage etc on which the virus maybe still alive even after 14 days and when they go home after the quarantine and open their baggage and start using stuff, they get infected. It has been proven now that the virus stay on surfaces for my longer than was earlier expected."

It’s a simple concept really, just cut the borders. It reduces cases and cuts the chances of outbreaks at hospitals like the one seen recently.

But, no, PAP has to accept flights from the country with the highest transmission rates yet, and punish the community for it. Crazy.

Edit: I also want to mention how the government is acting like our medical system is incapable of handling cases. 

What they should be focusing on are the number of deaths and rate of deaths, not the case numbers alone. It’s been established by many experts that considering how COVID-19 is so easy to transmit, that it will never truly be eradicated. COVID-19 will be the new flu, therefore the government should focus heavily on is distributing vaccines, which play a crucial role in reducing the chance of death in those who do end up catching it. Singapore’s healthcare system is one of the most capable in the world, which just extends to the fact that the government is overreacting over a dozen new cases. They are punishing the Singaporean people for their own mistake in the management of this pandemic."

361,gwwgzc6,Top 10 last words said before the actual thing
362,gwwgzha,India's govt has pretty much already given up at this point.
363,gwwh058,"So that people have time to fix their planned outings to 5 people only. 🤣
Also I feel if it’s immediate not everyone will be aware on time and use that as an excuse if get caught"
364,gwwh0b3,"Okay I'm going to reply for real instead of outrage baiting. Not sure how many people can honestly engage instead of being angry but here goes.

Could the government have reacted faster? I honestly think so. They reacted too slowly to the situation and it was terrible for optics. But was the border control as lax as many people are alluding to? No. 

Pretty sure all due diligence were made in terms of only allowing in essential/unavoidable people and also having SHN for each and every one of them when they enter. This is contrary to the impression that every tom dick harry from India was let in and allowed to run rampant in our community. 

Was there a leak in the end? Of course there is, that's why there's a cluster right now. But like I alluded earlier, the only surefire way of having 0 clusters is to shut off our borders totally till everything is over. So the government had to weigh the risks and they decided with the data they had that it was worth that risk. Was the assessment correct? We'll never know for sure since we don't have access to the same data they base their decision on. All we can do is look at the results and armchair critique the decision which is understandable but unfair. When things are weighed as probabilities, sometimes the gamble don't work out; even a 95% chance of winning a poker hand might result in the 5% happening. 

And going back to the Ikea comment. No, luckily no cluster resulted from the Ikea queue. But my broader point was that our people have been getting more and more complacent; kinda understandable taking into account crisis fatigue, but nonetheless not ideal. Can we control what the government decides through typing on Reddit and complaining on Facebook? Not likely. The only thing in our control is ourselves. If we think we are still in a crisis, act like it. I have 0 sympathies for people who have 101 complaints about our government's response while also part of the queues every weekend into our malls or complaining that we can't go gym-ing again.  

And I personally think that the Ikea queue was the most retarded thing ever, that's why that's the first example that popped into mind.

Extra note: I personally think the government should just mandate 100% WFH instead of this 50% recommendation bullshit, in case you guys think I'm just a shill."

I get that these measures are intended to keep all of us safe but given Hari Raya coming up, any little flexibility might go a long way to help families spend time together in a safe(r) way.

In the case of rejecting ICs, it's just to make tracetogether compulsory for the bluetooth function for improved contact tracing. Even ignoring the people who would turn off bluetooth on their phones, the number of people who don't do so + the people who use the token would increase the bluetooth contact tracing data significantly. Especially since the people who are scanning ICs are the elderly who would most likely use the token instead of the app."

Surely for 3 it should be done online wherever possible, and if not it can be delayed? And for 5, how come some people are allowed to travel for compassionate reasons, but not for our closest neighbours up until recently (https://cna.asia/3xGvq3t)?

Sure, Singapore should open up, but I feel that it should be on an exclusive basis, i.e. closed to everyone except the much-talked about travel bubbles that we keep trying to have. So if a country proves itself to be able to handle the virus properly, we can facilitate travel."

Our findings suggest that environmental contamination leading to SARS-CoV-2 transmission is unlikely to occur in real-life conditions, provided that standard cleaning procedures and precautions are enforced. 

If a person is carrying goods or stuff inside his luggage which presents a good environment for the virus to breed then it can be transmitted later because currently there is no fogging/uv treatment done for goods inside the luggage.

[Read this ](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54500673)

Quote - However, the research from Australian agency CSIRO found the virus was ""extremely robust,"" surviving for 28 days on smooth surfaces such as glass found on mobile phone screens and both plastic and paper banknotes, when kept at 20C (68F), which is about room temperature, and in the dark.
In comparison, the flu virus can survive in the same circumstances for 17 days.
The study, published in Virology Journal, also found SARS-Cov-2 survived for less time at hotter temperatures than cooler temperatures; it stopped being infectious within 24 hours at 40C on some surfaces.
It also stayed longer on smooth, non-porous surfaces than on porous materials such as cloth, which was found not to carry any infectious virus past 14 days

Inside luggage which would be dark, damp and and about 20-25 degrees, there is a good possibility of the virus staying on.

The reason I thought this is the case is because of that indian researcher who developed symptoms immediately after going home from quarantine. I guess the only thing which he would have done is probably opened up some bags which he hadn’t opened until now."

My optimism regarding this drops every day. The government looks like they are petrified of the bad PR of even 1 case, and opening up even with full vaccination will cause cases.

These new restrictions kind of prove it to me, they are panicking and don't have a proper re-opening plan.

Not to mention, it's not entirely their fault, there are tons of people even on this site that go apeshit when you suggest that after full vaccination, we can get rid of mandatory masks. A lot of people really DON'T want to go back to normal."

Once countries are vaccinated they might have millions of cases with no harm done. The issue is whether ppl are getting really sick/dying and overwhelming the health system.

553,gwwu3ov,"This comment got gilded...really? A comment with nothing but complains but no suggestions? What is a workable solution in your case? Its so difficult to have a proper discourse on any forum because nobody wants to factor every eventuality and every group that would be impacted by any decision being made. Bash the government, but think of solutions; have intelligent discussions and don't discount everyone who doesn't hate the government as a PAP shill. So what are the possibilities for border control?

a) Leave borders completely open. This is unfeasible as our extremely dense population and environment would mean that health systems would destroy themselves before any feasible mass vaccination could be rolled out. UK tried it, but still locked down. The US tried it, and suffered immensely for it, but they are recovering with speed of vaccination. Admittedly, we could have a faster vaccine rollout, but limited by doses available (which we should spend more to purchase).

b) Completely shut down all borders to any country until local populace is completely vaccinated or otherwise immune (as someone else commented). 

Referencing Australia and mainly NZ, their strategy focused on eliminating local spread, then keeping everyone out so that those who are in, enjoy life normally. Could Singapore do this? Yes, but it would impact many industries, not just construction. Many companies across manufacturing, transport, retail, F&amp;B all rely on foreign labour who need to sacrifice seeing their families for over a year (I have many in my team at work who haven't seen their family since Feb'20). If they go home, they can't come back in. Or if you had a family member who was working overseas temporarily - they are basically blocked from returning to their home country. Our service-heavy economy is fragile as it is, with little to no domestic demand and manufacturing; tourism is already shot in gut and dying, construction lacks the very workers we can't bring in (which is a product of the lowest-bidder culture fostered by the government, agreed). With all the cards on the table, its hard to deny that our economy would probably shrink and lose years of growth - this affects everyone, not just ""lining the ministers pockets"".

So, it makes sense as a mid-way point to allow people to leave Singapore to their home countries, but keep borders open enough to let people come back in, with approval required. 

c) Only allow selected visitors from certain countries to enter the country, with differing limitations based on incoming country. This is basically how our policy functions now. Working in an MNC, we have had to submit very lengthy approvals to get some of our workers back to Singapore. Malaysians, Indonesians, Chinese and yes, Indians. Many have went back because they had family members who passed away, or went back after a over a year without seeing their fiance/fiancee, to get married and come back to Singapore after a month or two, without knowing when the opportunity arises to return. But many of them have also lived here many years, many are PRs and we don't restrict PRs from returning home. Because it is their home.

Our day to day lives as Singaporeans have not suffered much in comparison. Our support network exists here, we still eat and visit friends, just in smaller groups. We have to mask up and are denied KTV :( but we still enjoy many of the luxuries from before. 

The government is not faultless. TraceTogether is a horrible privacy nightmare that should never have been greenlit. Although diplomatically stressful, they should have closed borders from India sooner. As mentioned before, our vaccine rollout has been incredibly laboured and should be a greater priority of the pandemic budget. They should also enforce WFH more heavy handedly rather than give ""suggestions"", in order to reduce public transport crowding.

But I don't believe ""they haven't come up with a workable solution to the borders"". They've done somewhat decently (B-/C+ ?) with what has to be considered.

I welcome any discussion please. Let's be intelligent and empathetic Singaporeans."

Secondly, cashflow is going to be a huge factor here because the companies can't drag out construction on a project forever. They have to pay suppliers but it'll be hard to do that when they don't have cashflow cause they haven't been paid because they havent hit milestones cause the govt stopped importing in construction workers for them

The govt can dont pay them. It just may result in bankruptcy if it drags too long. Then they'll have to deal with all the ppl who bought the construction"

620,gwx2m8z,"My stance is as follows:

a) Singaporeans and PRs should be allowed to come home. Australia's current ban is too heavy handed imo. BUT if the same people willingly fly back to other countries, then they should be subject to the same restrictions as everyone else, because they are choosing to take on that risk.

b) All other passes should be stopped for now. Then, slowly build up travel bubbles with countries that have demonstrated proper COVID management, i.e. NZ, Australia, HK, etc. I think this gives proper respect to these other countries that have properly controlled their case loads. I, for one, wouldn't want to be the health minister in NZ, opening up travel bubbles with Singapore, knowing full well that Singapore is still allowing travel from heavily hit countries. Why take on that additional risk?

c) Compassionate travel is debatable. I *empathize* with the affected people, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In the midst of a pandemic, heavy handed approaches should be enforced. The thing I don't understand is, why are we discussing compasionate travel with our closest neighbours (https://cna.asia/3xGvq3t), but allowing it for other countries? Imagine what Malaysians stranded in Singapore would think.

I think the government here is caught between a rock and a hard place. If they close off borders completely, people here will complain in 2022 when our economy is worse off. We're seeing the effects of what happens if they don't. But honestly, I think that constantly allowing people from what is currently the worst hit country was a mistake that was bound to blow up sooner or later. Had we gotten a case from a low risk country, such as HK, it would probably be brushed off as bad luck.

EDIT: Also, I find the ST Infographics a bit strange... talking about this one (https://i.imgur.com/4AgnUNa.jpg). To me, knowing their nationalities isn't as important as knowing WHERE and WHEN they got infected. Like, the nurse who got infected, I don't care whether shes a Philippine national or Singaporean, she got infected in Singapore, thats the key part.

Also, deadlines can be extended in a contract in cases like this, nobody is going to fault the contractor for not delivering with the supply crunch if any. Both of your points are essentially talking about the same thing regarding the fixed deadline they have to adhere to, which are in reality amenable. This is what happened last year when construction was totally put to a stop. Furthermore, the situation now is different, there is indeed a supply freeze but construction is still ongoing.

You also mentioned about the government paying foreign companies for construction. Foreign companies construction in Singapore is but a miniscule portion of their whole construction portfolio and profit. It would make more sense if you mention if the contract goes to a local contractor and forms a large part of their cashflow, that would be more worrying."

b) If I understand this right, no international travel unless RGL/bubble is in place? Ideal for encouraging more bubbles with countries of similar situations and COVID under control (for tourism!), but we risk alienating our more local SEA countries who don't have the same level of control over COVID, but provide disproportionately to our economy. 

c) That is a very good point. Our closest neighbour has been blocked off much more severely than other countries, and I cannot understand why either. 

Yup, fully agree with your closing statements. I think Singaporeans react too quickly to short-term impacts to their lifestyle and don't stop long enough to consider long term ramifications.

As it seems, this semi CB and all the people preaching to be vigilant is to help those coming in in future from being infected by the TTSH strain. 

No where in his post mentions the safety of Singaporeans. Only that the elderly need migrant workers to take care of them. 


“Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force dealing with the pandemic, said in a Facebook post on Tuesday night that unlike other large resource-rich countries, Singapore cannot afford to close its borders for a prolonged period.

As Singapore needs migrant workers, its approach is ""not to shut our borders permanently, but to manage them on a risk-based approach"", which is why it has implemented the latest measures given the global Covid-19 situation.

""Despite our best efforts, we cannot rely on border measures alone to control the infection. We must continue to do our part within the community to reduce interactions too and observe safe distancing rules,"" he wrote.

""Hence the need for the tighter community measures. By applying the full suite of measures and tools, we will give ourselves the best chance of bringing the current outbreak of cases under control."""

Do they deserve to have more exposure risk?

With this kind of health advisory, employers, especially those from SMEs, will only do the bare minimum, and there will still be exposure risk for the remaining 50% who are travelling to and fro for work.

u/mizzery123's point was that covid is more contagious and harder to contain than SARS, which is true. Take a look at [this research paper](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(20)30484-9.pdf) that compares covid, SARS and other viruses, there is a table on page 2 if reading research papers isn't your forte. 

* Covid has the highest R0, which suggests that it is the most contagious
* Covid has the longest incubation period, which translates to more people spreading it without knowing
* There is literally no interval between symptom onset and maximum infectivity for covid, which means people can shed infectious viral particles right when they develop symptoms. Compare this to SARS which takes 5-7 days after symptoms show to become infectious. Covid is harder to contain.
* Covid has a high proportion of mild cases, which makes it hard to detect 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes SARS produced more severe symptoms than covid. But from an **epidemiological** viewpoint, covid is much scarier because of how easily it can spread. The probable reason why SARS didn't cause a pandemic like covid is because it wasn't very contagious. Yes, people died easily from it, but it didn't bring the whole world into chaos and panic."

That means Singapore's position and influence in global trade will be compromised. Opening borders will not help much then.

What we need to do is to promote domestic industries and reduce reliance on the global economy, like what China is doing with their dual circulation strategy. I'm not asking Singaporeans to be farmers or factory workers (though if people want to they can), but we can be designing and producing high-end goods and services that are competitive enough in terms of quality and price that they can convince Singaporeans to buy local (or at least make them think twice about buying foreign goods).

Maybe finished electronic goods like watches, smartphones or even vehicles like cars and ships. Material-wise we still need to import definitely because we barely have any natural resources. But at least we can design and assemble the goods here. We may even become like Taiwan given that they are a major semiconductor maker despite being small in size and almost completely locked out of the international system.

In fact we don't even need to make very high-end goods. Simple things like designing and making our own clothes, stationery etc. also works. Remember that our local companies mostly serve our own people, so we just need to focus on providing for ourselves. We should not aim to replace foreign goods and services with domestic ones because that's just not feasible for our size. But at least have our domestic production make up a significant portion of our economy, alongside imports and exports.

Yeah of course. That's how people will naturally react, and that's an issue we need to work out without always resorting to subsidies like in Malaysia (I think China also do this. In fact I think many countries do this lol). If we can't compete in terms of price, maybe we can compete in terms of quality? People can also gravitate towards good quality products, especially those that can turn their brands into household names. Which will you prefer, Proton or Honda? Both are Asian-made cars, but one is cheaper and the other has a better reputation. People will give different answers depending on what they prioritise more.

&gt;A portion of our economy I could see it happening, but if its a significant portion, I cant see it happening

&gt; SINGAPORE: Limits on social gatherings and visitors to homes will be reduced from eight to five from May 8 to May 30 as Singapore tightens COVID-19 measures amid a rise in community cases.

&gt; People are also advised to keep to two or fewer social gatherings per day, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (May 4).

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The proportion of employees allowed to return to the workplace will also be reduced during the same period.

&gt; “Employers must ensure that no more than 50 per cent of employees who are able to work from home return to the workplace at any time,” MOH said. This is down from 75 per cent currently.

&gt; 

&gt; Social gatherings at the workplace should be avoided, said the ministry.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; ""However, if they cannot be avoided, for example during meal breaks, the gatherings are subject to the revised community limit of 5 persons,"" it added.

&gt; GYMS, FITNESS STUDIOS TO CLOSE

&gt; Indoor gymnasiums and fitness studios will have to close from May 8 to 30 as they have been identified as higher-risk settings.

&gt; ""These are small enclosed spaces where people are frequently unmasked while exercising, and in close proximity with many other unmasked people,"" said MOH.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Organised outdoor exercise programmes and classes may continue, subject to a class size of 30.

&gt; ""This includes group sizes of up to 5 persons and a 3-metre distance between each group,"" said MOH.

&gt; 

&gt; MOH said it will “remain vigilant” and continue to monitor other higher-risk settings and activities such as indoor sports halls and personalised services such as massages, spas, and facials.

&gt; “If the community cases situation does not improve, we will consider taking further actions on these higher-risk settings and activities,” MOH said.

&gt; Co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong said at a press conference that the measures will take Singapore back to Phase 2 for a few weeks.

&gt; ""This is not a circuit breaker. We certainly hope not to have to invoke another circuit breaker,"" he said.

&gt; While the measures will take effect on May 8, Mr Wong urged people to scale back on their activities as much as possible from Tuesday.

&gt; SMALLER GROUPS FOR EVENTS, PRE-TESTING REQUIREMENTS

&gt; To minimise the likelihood of large cluster formations, MOH said it will reduce event sizes and the limits caps beyond which pre-event testing is required.

&gt; Congregational and other worship services will from May 8 to May 30 require pre-event testing if there are more than 100 attendees at any one time, capped at 250 attendees.

&gt; “To further reduce the risks of transmission, congregational singing will be suspended in religious organisations to manage any risks of spread,” MOH said.

&gt; For weddings, the maximum number of attendees will be 250 attendees in total -including the wedding couple but excluding the licensed solemniser and vendors for the entire event - in zones of up to 50 attendees.

&gt; Pre-event testing will be required for the wedding couple for solemnisations involving more than 50 attendees, MOH said. Wedding receptions may also proceed with up to 250 attendees in total for the entire event, in zones or timeslots of up to 50 attendees each.

&gt; “Due to the higher risk at receptions where people are unmasked while enjoying their meals and come into close and prolonged contact mingling with one another, pre-event testing for all attendees (including the wedding couple) will be required for wedding receptions involving more than 50 attendees,” MOH said.

&gt; For funerals, attendees at the day of the burial or cremation will be limited to no more than 30 persons, down from 50 persons currently. The cap for other days of the wake remains at 30 attendees at any one time, MOH said.

&gt; As pre-event testing is not required, attendees are reminded to maintain safe distancing and keep masks on at all times to reduce the risk of spread, MOH added. As a new requirement, all mass participation sports events will be suspended and no spectators will be allowed. The maximum number of attendees allowed at live performances at designated venues, pilot business-to-business events and cinemas will be reduced from 750 to 250.

&gt; Pre-event testing will be required for all attendees of these events if there are more than 100 attendees. Similarly, cinema attendances will be reduced to 100 attendees, with the “potential to increase to 250 attendees with the additional requirement of pre-event testing”, MOH said.

&gt; Operating capacity will also be reduced from 65 per cent to 50 per cent at museums and public libraries.

&gt; Mr Wong said that while the hope is that the measures will slow down the COVID-19 spread, a circuit breaker is not out of the question.

&gt; ""If new unlinked cases continue to emerge in the coming days and weeks, then certainly, we will not hesitate to take even more stringent measures, even the possibility of having to enter another circuit breaker down the road,"" he said.

&gt; ""But let's try to avoid that scenario, and let's all do our part.""

977,gwzqwwe,why everyone assume only SMEs? I work for a fortune 100 MNC and big boss still wants us to go to office.
978,gwzrbru,SME more likely to do such things. MNCs less likely.
979,gwzt4fv,50% of current employees or 50% of building/office capacity? Cos some company have let go many of their employees already.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Indoor sports facilities will be closed temporarily from May 8 to May 30 to curb COVID-19 transmission within the community, Sport Singapore (SportSG) said on Thursday (May 6).

&gt; Public and private gyms, fitness and exercise studios, including those operated by commercial enterprises, national sports associations, country clubs, golf clubs, private apartments, condominiums, as well as charities, are to be closed.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; These premises are identified as ""high-risk sport and exercise environments"" that are indoors, where participants are in close contact, exerting and not wearing masks, said SportSG.

&gt; The premises must not be used or be hired out to others for use as an exercise or physical recreational facility. However, they can be used by a coach or instructor to conduct online classes.

&gt; 

&gt; Sports or recreational facilities can only admit a maximum number of people according to its gross floor area based on 10 sq m per person and up to a maximum of 50 people.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; ""No facility, regardless of size, shall admit more than 50 persons,"" said SportSG.

&gt; Group activities must also be confined to groups of no more than five people, a reduction from up to eight people a group when Singapore entered Phase 3 in its opening in December.

&gt; 

&gt; Physical distancing between the individuals and groups of five must be maintained while exercising and playing sport. An additional service provider, such as an instructor or a coach, from a permitted enterprise may guide the group for organised programmes and classes.

&gt; 

&gt; Multiple groups of five are allowed, with up to 30 people or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower, said SportSG.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; It added that intermingling between groups are not allowed and groups should remain 3m apart.

&gt; ""Large complexes or multi-function premises such as country clubs may treat different parts of their premises as separate facilities, provided that they are well separated by physical barriers such that intermingling is not possible,"" SportSG said.

&gt; LARGE OUTDOOR CLASSES AT PUBLIC SPACES ALLOWED TO CONTINUE

&gt; 

&gt; Large outdoor classes at public places, such as parks and HDB common areas, can continue if they are approved.

&gt; However, the total class size must be reduced to 30 people, including participants, the registered instructor and any assistants, and is also subject to the venue capacity limit.

&gt; 

&gt; Other safe management measures will continue to remain in place, said SportSG. These include mask-wearing, avoiding sharing of common equipment, reducing physical interaction and ensuring safe distancing.

&gt; Facility owners or operators should also conduct temperature screening and checks for visible symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, breathlessness and a runny nose on visitors. Those with fever or appear unwell will be turned away.

&gt; 

&gt; SafeEntry must be implemented for participants and visitors. All participants and staff members are to use either the TraceTogether App or Token for SafeEntry from May 17.

&gt; MASS PARTICIPATION SPORTS EVENTS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE

&gt; Mass participation sports events will not be allowed to take place, said SportSG. Organisers are to work with SportSG to cancel or postpone the events to a later date.

&gt; All other sports events, including live spectator events, competitions and tournaments, will be subjected to approval before they can proceed. No spectators will be allowed at sports events and tournaments.

&gt; ""National sports associations that are organising competitions and tournaments related to qualifications for international competitions for national athletes, should approach SportSG early to discuss their plans,"" it said.

&gt; SportSG added that government agencies will be conducting inspections. Enforcement action under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act will be taken against businesses or individuals who fail to comply with safe management measures.

&gt; SINGAPORE: The current size of group gatherings allowed will be reduced from five people to two people, following a spike in COVID-19 community cases, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong on Friday (May 14).

&gt; This, and other new measures under what the Health Ministry labelled as ""Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)"" will take effect from May 16 through June 13.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, he said: “This will apply across the board, so if you want to go out for anything, grocery shopping, exercise, maximum of two persons henceforth.

&gt; “In fact, we strongly encourage everyone to stay home as much as possible, go out only for essential reasons.”

&gt; “We will do a review at the midway point, meaning two weeks after the measures have been implemented, and at that point we will look at the prevailing public health situation and see if there’s a need to adjust the measures further,” he added.

&gt; “We are in a stage of heightened alert. I would urge everyone to be vigilant and minimise unnecessary social interactions,” said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; “We need to act decisively to disrupt the virus transmission. We will therefore further tighten safe management measures in the community”

&gt; DINING-IN SUSPENDED, WORK-FROM-HOME AS DEFAULT

&gt; Dining-in at F&amp;B establishments will also not be allowed, said Mr Wong. This includes hawker centres and food courts, both indoors and outdoors.

&gt; “We will take tighter measures around the higher risk settings, and these higher risk settings are the ones where people are gathered together in an indoor environment without their mask on,” said Mr Wong.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; “All dining-in will have to cease … All F&amp;B establishments will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. In line with this, wedding banquets will also have to cease because it’s a dining activity.”

&gt; Working from home will also be the default at workplaces, he added. “All employees who are able to work from home will have to do so. Work-from-home will be the default.”

&gt; The cap of five distinct visitors per household per day will also be reduced to two distinct visitors per household per day, Mr Wong said.

&gt; “Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than two per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place,” said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release.

&gt; Grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not count towards the cap of two distinct visitors or the number of social gatherings per day, said MOH in the press release.

&gt; “However, grandparents are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from COVID-19 infection. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households,” said the Health Ministry.

&gt; Other activities that will not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise classes, or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities, said MOH in the press release.

&gt; Personalised services that need masks to be removed like facials and saunas, singing and playing instruments that need “require intentional expulsion of air” like wind or brass instruments, will also not be allowed. However, medical and dental services can continue, the press release noted.

&gt; EVENT SIZES AND PRE-EVENT TESTING

&gt; Event sizes and event size caps will be further scaled down, said Mr Wong.

&gt; Currently, events can have 100 attendees without pre-event testing and 250 with pre-event testing. This will be scaled down to 50 and 100 attendees respectively, he added.

&gt; This will apply to congregational and other worship services and MICE activities, said Mr Wong.

&gt; “Likewise, we will reduce the capacity limits across the board for shopping malls, showrooms and attractions, as well as cruises, museums, public libraries, all of these capacity limits will be scaled back,” he added.

&gt; For congregational and other worship services, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times “to further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions”, said MOH in the press release.

&gt; Live singing and playing of wind instruments will also be suspended during this period.

&gt; The operating capacity of attractions that have received prior approval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry will be reduced to 25 per cent from the current 50 per cent. Museums and public libraries will also be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 20 per cent. Indoor and outdoor shows can proceed with up to 100 people with pre-event testing and up to 50 without, said MOH.

&gt; This also applies to cinemas, but the group size of two people applies. Food and beverages also cannot be sold or consumed in the cinema. The cap for funeral attendees will also be reduced from the current 30 people to 20 people, said MOH in the press release.

&gt; 

&gt; Marriage solemnisations will be allowed to continue, with a cap of 50 and 100 attendees without and with pre-event testing respectively, the press release read.

&gt; “We know that there is one group who will be particularly impacted too, which are wedding couples. Some of them may already have wedding plans for this coming Sunday, and it may be very hard to make last minute changes,” said Mr Wong.

&gt; For affected couples, the government is “prepared to consider grandfathering the arrangement” for couples who have already made plans for Sunday, he added.

&gt; “They can proceed, but we will require them to put in place pre-event testing for all their guests. But this is a special arrangement only for this Sunday because this is a once in a lifetime event for the wedding couples.”

Imo the better way than full lockdown. As long as many non-essential businesses can remain open to keep a portion of the economy going.

Biggest thing right now is still schools; all of them have to be de facto under lockdown right now; only exception like practical lessons (like my Engineering classes) should be allowed to be remain carried out albeit in much smaller groups."

Some (India) just can't give a shit and are ruining it for the rest of the world, not to mention our government's own failure to allow them to enter Singapore at all."

1213,gy2gcnp,The government needs to speed up vaccinations now by giving young people their first doses now and defer their second dose like what Canada and UK does. Canada accelerated vaccinations and has seen cases begin to drop.

There's no plan for ending this because all the govt is looking at is 'case' numbers, not hospitalisations or ICU stats. 

Hospitalisations are at 150 with 3 in ICU. A week before, it was 142 with 3 in ICU. So that's an increase of 8 that triggered this"
1226,gy2ggf0,definitely already planned. They already had 'experts' preparing us for the news. 'Next few weeks very important' or some shit

And after that, whichever countries still have uncontrolled covid spread, be they BIG or small countries, refuse border entry to them. BIG countries should stop their shit bullying others, threatening others, or take the opportunity to expand their influence globally in this time of crisis.

Especially given that the vast majority of Singaporeans have unquestioningly accepted and adhered to whatever restrictions and measures that were imposed on us for more than a year. 

Who is responsible for being in bed with corporations and refusing to implement a permanent work from home arrangement, but instead force the working class back to the office, resulting in dozens of strangers being jam-packed into every single mrt carriage on the way to school and work during peak hours every day?

Who is responsible for making this country's economy a sham entirely reliant on unsustainable population growth, exploitation of cheap foreign labour, and being a prostitute to foreign capital, such that we have no choice but to continue an open-door import policy in the midst of a pandemic?

I'm so sick and tired of ordinary Singaporeans having to bear responsibility and having to pay the price for the mistakes of our so-called elite leadership."

When you look at how USA was before, it is a massive change for the better seeing how fucking awful 2020 was for them. And they aren't stopping either.

Singapore depends on foreign labour to build houses or blue-collar jobs due to government policies, refused to build surplus of houses but rather build-to-order or implement minimum wage so that blue-collar jobs like waitresses or construction worker can earn a livable wage, now they’re blaming Singaporeans for being overly dependent on foreign labour - so we better suck thumb and let them in, regardless if they are from high-risk countries or not.

Come on, we can’t do anything but let the government tell us what to do and how to feel - we can’t look for alternative housing solutions because private property is so expensive, public housing is controlled by the government policies so what can I say if I want to buy a house built by people who are paid proper wages? We can’t take blue-collar jobs because government wants to train us to do PMET jobs, and blue-collar jobs don’t earn a livable wage in Singapore.

What are we supposed to do? Seriously - I want to help better our society and reduce how reliant we are on foreign labour - but it’s literally impossible to do so in Singapore because of the policies put in place.

1555,gy2jinp,dont see anything about nsmen
1556,gy2jj0p,"As usual, the poor and middle class pay for the mistakes of the rich and the ministers. Good job govt! We should pay them even more!"
1557,gy2jj2l,Thanks a lot for caring :) Nice to know there are good folks around
1558,gy2jjd8,The last elections we gave the incumbent the mandate😔
1559,gy2jjyj,"The solution is to fight back. Make them listen. To hell with the masks, to the group restriction, we have to show what we're made off."
1561,gy2jk9m,one hour posted and already hundreds of comments! glad to know we all went straight here to check what everyone is saying
1562,gy2jken,"Ah. Yet again sinkie blame sinkie. The rules are so fucking arbitrary and SG has one of the strictest mask mandates in the world. There were weeks with 0-1 community cases. Then crisis in India, now look what happened. Nothing changed in Singapore between those periods"
1563,gy2jkg0,"Someone of high age with a long list of co-morbidities, which is true for almost every case that Singapore had registered. Singapore is even honest enough to list these cases as ""died WITH COVID"", admitting that it is not clear if COVID was even responsible for the death. This is simply how old people have died since forever. Our population is healthy enough to ride this out naturally (low obesity, good nutrition, relatively active daily life routines, good exposure to sunlight), especially with all the restrictions that we had already in place."
1564,gy2jki9,RIP claude.

1569,gy2jl7u,People are going to flock to the parks. Where else can 2 people gather when dining is not allowed?
1570,gy2jlrj,Bro u said 3 idiots is favourite among your foreign uni people. Why do they relate to it? Is education same there as in India? I thought it was different
1571,gy2jmbs,"It's different. They could've done something about it to prevent this situation from happening, yet we are the ones who have to pay it with our lives."
1572,gy2jn22,"They cant, otherwise they have to pay us all to sit at home and twiddle our thumbs for another month"
1573,gy2jn5x,at least a million plus.
1574,gy2jndv,Hopefully more of your congregation also want the same thing. Senseless to have in person services now. Do you even need a service or could you just read the bible and do some praying on your own?

1576,gy2jnjl,"&gt; It is immensely frustrating seeing many other countries slowly getting back to some semblance of normalcy, but here we are (in the so-called best place in the world to be during Covid) now subject to a second lockdown

These other countries have been in perpetual lockdown since March last year, all whilst we were operating cruises, theme parks, and encouraging domestic tourism."

1582,gy2jqqo,"Not that it affects me immediately since I'm neither a student nor parent, but no mention of schools? I guess Covid is more lenient towards them."
1583,gy2jqzo,"so upsetting. i was a fresh grad when the pandemic kicked in, lived in a period of uncertainty. getting rejection emails from jobs every other week. took me a year plus to finally get an internship. i literally started a week and a half ago. i am so fucking happy finally doing what i truly love. even though whatever i’m doing is considered an essential service, i still am getting flashbacks of anxiety during my time in circuit breaker. 

please stay safe everyone. we know who fucked up here.  and i’m as angry and frustrated. i am thinking of those who are in limbo, or who might get thrown into limbo again. 

let’s just do the best we can to stay healthy for us and our vulnerable family members. 

be safe"
1584,gy2jr6b,"Actually, Australia and NZ did not mini-lockdown the whole country, it was just specific cities/towns that was needed. So technically, the country was still functioning.

Just wish to highlight this point"

1589,gy2js78,"For real. Maybe a week lockdown like Australia, sure. But a fucking month?"
1591,gy2jsl8,Older than you by a decade but exactly how I feel. The power imbalance is ridiculous.
1592,gy2jsoq,"Yup. The poor and middle class always pay for the mistakes of our ministers, but we continue to give them millions so they ""cannot be bribed"" and that ""talents"" will want to work as ministers.

1597,gy2jtrc,They really need to speed up the vaccine rollout.
1598,gy2ju00,"We did our part. The virus is spreading once again because the government kept admitting people from high-risk countries, not because people weren’t wearing masks or otherwise observing safety measures. 

Any attempt at trying to blame the local populace is simply trying to deflect blame from the real culprit - the government."
1599,gy2ju16,Just vote them out already. The leadership is morally bankrupt and too comfortable.
1600,gy2jub6,Those imports meant to create value for our society better be worth this. I'm tired 😫

1609,gy2jx7u,"Same here. Secured a job but waiting for paperwork.

Hoping it doesn't happen to us but have to be prepared."
1610,gy2jxfe,I wonder if Valu$ will get to remain open this time round?
1611,gy2jxs9,Well technically its not false information. Its official that the mayors earn that amount
1612,gy2jxsh,"Ya because vaccines are gonna help when its not 100% foolproof and you keep letting foreigners in because ""muh GDP"". 

Thank your lovely and wealthy ministers for this."
1613,gy2jycn,There is 3 people in the intensive care unit and as a result Singapore gets shut down and livelihoods get destroyed. Does this make sense to you?
1614,gy2jyws,It is. What changed in the recent weeks?
1615,gy2jyxd,"He was ok but I like how GKY, the HEALTH MINISTER is just in the background chilling.

No sense of urgency."

1620,gy2k1nx,I wouldn’t bet against it.
1621,gy2k26s,"don't worry, just pay our ministers MORE so more talents will want to work here and to keep them even more incorruptible. Get more paper scholars and officers in, they'll save singapore by letting in more people and increase our GDP! Fuck all those hawker centres, they don't increase GDP much anyway! And fuck the middle class and the poor, too! the only people that matter are scholars and ministers!"
1623,gy2k2np,well that would solve the problem of 1 parent bringing siblings to school (so &gt; 2 people travelling together). but month-long term break is coming a couple of weeks anyway.
1625,gy2k3by,Sucks bro.

1627,gy2k437,ugh i just booked for my facial on sunday and now i cant go.. forever ugly i guess
1628,gy2k48a,"Firstly, using a throwaway account because: Singapore and also because of my work implications which I won’t go into much detail of. As someone who has been working closely on this, I’m personally very annoyed and disillusioned with the way the Govt has been handling this issue. 

When covid-19 variants were announced from the UK, Singapore was very quick to take strict measures, because there wasn’t much to gain. In comparison with variants coming in from India, the Govt decided to prioritise our construction industry and took a very long time in taking other covid-19 variants seriously. It seems like their efforts to boost the economy has instead, backfired. 

I’m sure that fellow my Singaporeans are upset regarding all of the new updates coming in. But would love to know if people who do not see what I see genuinely feel the same way/or vice versa."
1629,gy2k4pd,"you can still go to malls, attractions and libraries. So it is not a FULL circuit breaker"

1647,gy2kapw,"Yea, we're under MSF policy (not in MSF, so not public servant) so I don't think that is gonna help. We kept to split teams even after the 75% rule so I can't complain too much, except for my direct boss who is constantly throwing my team under the bus to return to the office while he works from home.

1653,gy2kdpw,"It's been almost 6 months since vaccines are available. Why is Singapore's vaccination rate so pitiful? Why aren't people complaining about this; none of these measures would be needed if we were at 60-70% vaccination rate by now (which would have been doable for a country that is so small, rich and supposedly efficient)."

1657,gy2kfy9,There is. Watch the CNA conference video
1658,gy2kg60,CB-lite!
1659,gy2kgav,Guess it's back to eating bread at void decks.
1660,gy2khg9,Bro. The current cluster has spread because of an ICA checkpoint. It can't be more obvious
1661,gy2kils,The COVID vaccines are 100% effective at preventing deaths and serious illness for all variants. Ensuring as many people as possible get their first doses now is crucial to saving lives.
1662,gy2kisq,"Worst news to wake up to, on my birthday. Great. Already half-dying with all the empty, unsincere birthday wishes, and now this."
1664,gy2kkcl,"Honestly what else could they have done to move Singapore forward after the LKY &amp; GCT era? We are really a piece of small Island with no back up other than ourselves. Sustaining the immense success from LKY era is really harder than you could imagine. There's only so many of us that have the credentials and brave enough to be politicians and Singapore will never be as democratic as it seems to be.   


Singapore property price partly relied on ""unsustainable population growth "". Singapore's appeal to foreign investment from MNC and help local Towkays make money also partly relied on "" cheap foreign labour "".  Quality employment positions for Singaporeans relied on "" foreign capital "". We are all responsible for the country's economy because of our lofty expectations after the success of LKY management of Singapore. It is anything but a sham.  


Yes, they screwed up time and again for covid and we are paying for their mistakes now. But we were also enjoying the success of their governance before all these. Safety, Clean water, Good education, Pride of being a Singaporean and holding Singapore passport. Let's calm down and call a spade a spade."
1665,gy2kku2,Pretty sure a private hangout spot for two that you can rent by hour is going to be pretty popular
1666,gy2kl8w,"With the way the latest variant is spreading, a lockdown is inevitable. The question we should be asking is this: Did it ever make sense to allow short-term travellers from high-risk countries in the first place, regardless of quarantine measures?"

1680,gy2kt6q,We should highlight that was before this round of restrictions
1681,gy2ktf8,"Call me a devil's advocate but I think you're being entirely irresponsible if you continue to host a wedding during a pandemic. Weddings are by far the most unnecessary ceremony to even be held in a time like this and nothing ever justify this because the world doesn't revolve around you.

It sucks that you probably already made deposit, sunk-cost fallacy is real. However, I'm sure a refund is likely to be successful. So be patient and wait it out, you don't need a glamorous ceremony to proclaim your love to someone else, or else your affectation to impress is appalling."

1683,gy2ku4j,"Did an ant ask itself why bother living when it's whole life is about working non stop? Did those Jews ask themselves why bother living when they were being oppressed and massacred during the holocaust?  


Because life is worth living no matter how tough it gets unless you have insufferable disease or pain."
1684,gy2kuey,"In my opinion, the construction workers are a one-time movement issue, bring them in, quarantine, and onboard them. The other pass holders if you noticed, tend to fly back and forth every couple of months. I believe we could have restricted approvals to fly back and forth for this segment, while letting our CMP workers in-country."
1685,gy2kv0t,"Did they pay you, to make such beautiful comment?"
1686,gy2kvw2,No idea. I’m just waiting to see if i will be receiving any emails from the hotel i’ve booked for staycay over Vesak Day.
1687,gy2kvze,"Question, is everyone still going to staycay?"
1688,gy2kx5z,Lmao spot on.
1689,gy2kx6r,Sometimes its the parents who wanna show off...
1690,gy2kxn0,If one person protest they can arrest that person. If a group of people protest they can arrest them. However if everyone also protest they cant do shit
1691,gy2ky4c,"I feel bad for the hawker centre stalls.

Can't they give open air non-airconditioned hawkers an exemption, while still limiting the table group size to two, with social distancing?"
1692,gy2kycs,How about closing the damn borders and accepting 0 covid is not possible?
1693,gy2kyef,The mask mandate should be here to stay no matter how vaccinated we are. I don't think these western govts r making the best decisions for everyone as a whole.
1694,gy2kypq,"Yes that's the thing, so many here are not realising why this isn't called CB... It's just more restrictive than Phase 2"
1695,gy2kytn,"You're in a CB, but it's not a CB."
1696,gy2kzbr,I would assume taking children to school doesn't count as a gathering? It would be hard to take both of my children at the same time if I can only be out in a group of 2.
1697,gy2kzpx,last time is cb now is lj lah (legally jailed) or some other weird abbreviation.
1698,gy2l07h,Stay safe!
1699,gy2l0ce,Yes. Israel has about the same sized population and they spent what it took to get first in the queue and get enough vaccine to jab everyone. Why didn't we? Spending an extra $5 for a vaccine is a lot cheaper than shutting down the country on a rolling basis.
1700,gy2l2am,Which is why I just cancelled my wedding reception - too many family members from overseas and also like not sure when Covid gonna end. So just ROM then like have a five year anniversary party with everyone lor. At least I don’t have the live with the instability
1701,gy2l4e7,"Yea, seems like a good idea, a [recent study](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/14/delay-in-giving-second-jabs-of-pfizer-vaccine-improves-immunity) (but yet to be peer reviewed) in the UK suggests improved immunity when the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine is taken after 12 weeks, so delaying it not only ensures more people can get vaccinated quickly, but could also improve immunity as well"
1702,gy2l4k6,Stay safe :)
1703,gy2l4te,"The biggest difference is, we're still allowed to go out in pairs, that's not what we could do during CB isnt it?"
1704,gy2l6t3,"People just voicing out their stress and disappointments. Nobody is insisting on going ahead with the ceremony.


Nobody even mentioned anything about glamorous ceremony. It might just be a simple 50pax wedding dinner for the immediate family which has been postponed again and again.


Let people voice their frustrations. It's not even an unreasonable complain."

1708,gy2l8bi,"Didn't spend enough to ensure we got the vaccines first. That's it, that simple."
1709,gy2l8br,at some point everyone has to realize this virus will be here forever. gov cant just lockdown like this every year when cases inevitably rise.
1710,gy2l8yb,"Actually you’re not wrong, but according to my work sources, construction at mid tier also has a lot of ins and outs just like the maritime workers. So overall it’s probably the CMP industry as a whole. However, it’s very hard to justify whether to open a country if a plane that comes in results in 75% covid cases (this is what I see at work) while reporting comes in based on when the people from the plane gets sick, so they never share that it’s people from a particular area/flight vs just this number of cases a day. It’s optics!"

In Singapore, COVID-19 has so far killed ~30 people in &gt;1 year since its arrival. Compare that to all the fallout from these measures in terms of income loss, mental health issues, poorer quality education for our primary/secondary schoolers, and even vaccine side effects (MOH themselves reported ~50 ""severe/potentially fatal"" adverse reactions so far), and vaccine-related spending.

The cure should not be this much worse than the disease.

The way that the government have been carrying themselves could be summarised as arrogant and you can literally smell the contempt that they have for the average Singaporean. 

I do see the good work that they have done over the last 50 years to bring Singapore to where we are now but this current iteration is simply unlikable and possibly incompetent. 

And this is without mentioning their dozen other controversies and mistakes since they were handed their ‘mandate’ (via a hastily called election during the height of the pandemic). Funnily enough that ‘mandate’ led us right back into a “Not CB” CB.

The earlier people get vaccinated, the more lives are saved. 

There is now strong evidence to show the first dose is far more important than the second dose. The rationale for the second dose seems to be to confer long term protection, and the first dose seems to be to stop the spread, and decrease mortality. In the short term, the latter is way more important than the former."

We are in full lockdown, and I guarantee it will go longer than just this one month. Not from “hygiene” it’s because imported cases have already transmitted to locals, and some can be asymptomatic.

The diff is clear. The US government has done a great job with their vaccination campaign. We have not, and yet continue to import more people and cases into our country. The Govt has to take ownership of this systemic failure, but I don’t think they will."
1860,gy2myew,"It's not really a catch 22. It's just a cost we need to accept, a cost that some other countries have already accepted. 

The solution to the over reliance is to drastically reduce and eventually eliminate the number of work permits granted to foreign construction workers, and force labour intensive construction companies to hire locals only, and pay them way way more, combined with increased productivity, to do construction.

Make no mistake this will be very very painful in the short term. To pay for this our HDBs will either rise in price significantly or the cost increase will need to be absorbed with government subsidies funded by higher taxation, or perhaps very steep discount in government land sales to HDB, which also reduces government revenue. In the short term we can expect BTOs to take up to 8 years to complete as a norm. Some less efficient and adaptable construction companies will necessarily go out of business, and this will have some impact of local employment. Globally we will be seen as a less competitive economy with higher taxes and cost of business and cost of living.

But once we get through the transition period, in the longer term, as industry and economy adjusts, we may have a construction industry that looks more similar to that of Japan and Australia. Construction workers will be local and earn higher wages. Everything will likely be more expensive. More of your income may need to go towards housing and taxes, but that's the price we need to pay if we want to live in a country without low wage foreign workers, if that's what we decide as a country to be our top priority.

It sounds painful but I think we should be honest with ourselves and tackle the problem head on instead of pretending that there is an easy answer. I'm personally very torn, but lean towards the view that we just need to swallow the short term bitter pill and start phasing out exploitative foreign labour. 

If you agree with me, you can play a part in either voicing your support for this by voting for parties that want this (e.g. WP), writing to your MPs about this, and persuading your friends to hold this point of view."

The government doesn’t want a full CB because enacting that would be tantamount to an admission that they have obviously failed in their Covid governance, when most countries in the world are opening up again.

1909,gy2nsne,Yep..
1910,gy2ntdy,If I no call it CB then it is no CB
1911,gy2ntpv,I agree. But r/sg people are very risk averse
1912,gy2ntwk,Thanks for the hardwork! Stay safe out there
1913,gy2nv4t,!Remindme 4 years
1914,gy2nvfc,"Thanks for the reply. I feel like the 2nd wave was an inevitable thing, as most other countries have faced (New Zealand, HK etc.).

Do you think that the appropriate response should have been a complete lockdown 1-2 weeks ago? I just feel like Singaporeans were quite used to the relaxing of measures/phase 3, so I'm surprised at the amount of anger about this issue now."
1915,gy2nvj4,no

1921,gy2nxgu,South Asia is not a country. India is a country. Still beating around the bush.

1924,gy2o06c,"Wait, how do i send my 2 kids to school if max group size is 2?"
1925,gy2o2nk,Doesnt help right. You think WP can do any better?
1926,gy2o38c,"While I agree with you generally, I don't feel sorry at all for many of the high-end restaurants. 

Many of them have been full every seating since June, booked out weeks in advance, and have increased their prices significantly to exploit the captive population which has nowhere to go and nowhere to spend money. I know people who work at these places and many of them say it's the best trading period they've had for a very long time.

The Government should target its support more carefully to those restaurants, etc which are actually struggling, e.g. businesses which require high volume, high turnover but who were impacted by social distancing, restricted opening hours, etc even throughout Phases 2 and 3. Michelin-starred restaurants charging three-figures for lunch and with weeks of advanced bookings, not so much."
1927,gy2o3gc,You mean use the nutella to bake the nutella bread myself? Don't think Valu$ sells that.
1928,gy2o3rh,There are no long term gains with closing borders or locking down
1929,gy2o3s8,"I had my first jab a couple of weeks ago. Straight after registering I went in to receive it. That tells me that they are working far under capacity.

1933,gy2o87g,"So capped at two people - ok. What if you have 4 in your family, you live together. Are you not allowed to go out together?"
1934,gy2o8fx,"It’s mainly about borders. Borders should have never been opened, and even if it was for a short period of time. People from high infected areas should have never been allowed into SG."
1935,gy2o96l,wonder the same.
1936,gy2o9y5,Yep exactly. Cases may be increasing but hospitalization and deaths aren’t.
1937,gy2obgl,not all students can be strong and independent
1938,gy2odsb,"The 5-6 million people outside… of which 3 million doses have been administered, and almost 2 million vaccinated- of which most of them are in vulnerable groups… Essentially reducing the likelihood of death from COVID for the bulk/overwhelming bulk of the population…?"
1939,gy2oews,STI can short one meh
1940,gy2oh3p,Phase 1 then
1941,gy2oh6y,I just wanted to do my monthly grocery haul why they announce it so early
1942,gy2ohtx,"I think border control was absolutely too lax and too reactive. And i really would have preferred if they just did a snap lockdown on the 7th, but i fully understand why they might have been reluctant to do so because of Hari Raya. (They do have to consider social welfare after all.)

Also the constant gaslighting by the media and the ministers isn’t helping at all. I personally would not even be that pissed off if the government/ministers took responsibility for the current spike in cases and issued some sort of apology."
1943,gy2oig4,somebody failed for this inconvenience caused
1944,gy2oioq,Blowdart to his ass
1945,gy2oisq,"Wrong. It was not heightened on our account. The virus was already known to be way more contagious then the previous variant. Hence, even if we stuck to the previous safe distancing measures we would have gotten it either way. The only possible way to have stopped it was to have stopped the importation."
1947,gy2ojec,Cai shen ye meme on LW face
1948,gy2ojkr,"Hospitalization was 142 last week. Before that was 132 the week before iirc. Was discussing this with a friend over case numbers. Despite getting 10 per day or so, we don't actually hospitalise most of them. In fact, very few of them are hospitalised"
1949,gy2ol8z,U are so so wrong - I had colleagues who went to India in June 20 and could only return in Feb/ March 21 cos they weren't getting permit to travel.. and I don't work in construction so approvals were impossible to come by..  none of my friends travelled back unless emergency since they knew they couldn't come back once they fly out
1950,gy2olka,Bubble Bubble Pop! Pop!
1951,gy2on3k,do you even know why the community cases shot up?
1952,gy2ooj4,It does but nothing like the 30+ million doses administered. Many come from the EU and India.
1953,gy2op05,"I was at NTUC doing my weekly grocery shopping just now. 

Saw a snake like queue outside after I step out of NTUC..."
1955,gy2oraf,"Despite some being sloppy not a single cluster has been formed in estate areas where people tend to intermingle more. We did the best we could, how long more can we tolerate the restrictions. 

You see alot of people breaking social distancing measures everywhere. Yet this new surge of cases are mainly because of the imported cases. The gov basically shit on all of our efforts and not single one of them wants to own up to fucking up"
1956,gy2orsq,"I swear this Calvin Cheng on FB starting to piss me off with his comments, it’s so ridiculous"
1957,gy2osz3,"If you can’t smell the CB, please go get yourself tested 👀"
1958,gy2otbp,I'm 200% sure that he was just joking. Chill lad. It's a COVID-related thread in a Singaporean subreddit.
1959,gy2otl2,"I see. I think it's quite a tough decision to not allow any foreigners from India into Singapore though, considering how much we rely on them for labour-intensive jobs. If you close the borders on them, it's a decision you would need to stick to for at least a year or even longer, considering how bad the spread of the virus is there currently. 

I don't know exactly how large the impact would be if we close our borders to countries majorly affected by COVID, but I don't think it's so easy a decision for a nation like Singapore."
1960,gy2ovyw,Rag and bone man 💀
1961,gy2ownx,"BS lmao, when a country's COVID woes are repeatedly reported on around the world, I say that's objectively high risk"
1962,gy2oyyf,But Singapore is not China.
1963,gy2ozns,"Exactly. Add to that financial resources, very high state capacity, a generally well behaved and compliant population, great health care, strong logistics and high levels of diplomacy with all the right global governments. Singapore could very easily have been the first nation on the planet to complete its vaccination program."
1964,gy2p09j,"Sorry dude, i mean this one https://www.chocoexpress.com.sg/nutella-bready-t6-132g-2-for-6

1965,gy2p0e1,Still can get my haircut
1966,gy2p0g4,I suppose you mean the Changi airport cluster?
1967,gy2p2lm,"But it is fake news if they are indeed not paid $660k.

POFMA means their salary should be way more than that (cause it wouldn't make sense to pay ministers less than a mayor. Later corruption how?). 

Don't POFMA means the $660k is the benchmark."
1968,gy2p2mk,Maybe I missed it but are we going back to the CB measure of only allowing essential shops and services be opened?
1969,gy2p3gg,"Sorry, just need to vent:

""Broke through""?!?! What kind of half fucked explanation/excuse is that when despite numerous people asking for a travel ban or heightened measures were just blithely ignored?"
1970,gy2p72i,Be safe
1971,gy2p733,"It's not safe at 22:35, the virus can tell the time or something."
1972,gy2p8v5,"Everywhere has their own variant. We heard about the UK variant, the cali variant, the african variant, the brazil variant. Almost every country was objectively higher risk than Singapore

Even despite indias current covid issues, their deaths per capita still lower than a lot of europe. Same for cases per capita"
1973,gy2pa9g,Thank you India
1974,gy2pb5g,"This past 15 months has truly been revealing and eye-opening in terms of how our leaders handle crises. 

First, there was the complete fuck-up with the foreign dorm cases, then there was the cynical, grossly opportunistic calling of elections in the midst of the pandemic, the slow vaccine roll-out coupled with a lack of transparency, and now the again slow, reactive instead of proactive border management policies. 

I really do hope people have longer memories this time around."
1975,gy2pc11,小弟七逃无马走
1976,gy2pd9e,Because most of us voted for this. LOL
1977,gy2pdau,Cannot go for food dates then go where? Now also nothing much to do except go out eat
1979,gy2pf77,"Sadly, I still think the results will be the same. A lot of things hasn’t changed in SG, so I wouldn’t expect the future to be any different. 

However in the next election, I think current Gen Z will be more likely to vote for opposition"
1980,gy2pfod,will my derm be affected during these?
1981,gy2phgg,"Unless they close schools this makes zero sense. Parents with 2 kids cannot be expected to make 2 round trips to send their kids. I have friends with 3 school-going children. Make 3 trips? 

They said grandparents who take care of grandchildren on a daily basis will not have the grandchildren counted towards the 2 distinct visitors limit. Again, if they have more than 2 grandchildren from the same child, the logistics of sending the grandchildren to grandparents' home is again ridiculous."
1982,gy2pi5b,"Those mofos who eased up the borders (cos GDP ... and bonus)  whilst the Variant virus which devastated India was raging are solely responsible for our current Lockdown. How about everytime we get restrictive measures, their salary gets cut 30 percent permanently? Maybe these mofos will get their act together ....."
1983,gy2piat,"Thank you SIA, in order to let you continue burning cash, we now have this. 

Something in the past...harikiri something something

Still have the cheek to get yahoo finance to hype you up, shame on you."
1984,gy2pin1,"You blame India for what? Why not blame our incompetent gov? Or why not blame China for creating the virus in the first place? Knowing India isn’t a very smart nation, it was expected for their cases to spread exponentially. But this all stemmed from China, and rn, it’s our current gov that has massively messed up to make us go back to phase 1"
1985,gy2pjfs,"Urge ah, okay i give 10% discount."
1986,gy2pk9f,"I think the appropriate response should be a firm &amp; quick decision like how NZ/AU do it. The last two weeks have been them flipping prata and not wanting to make any decisive calls, giving a very vague/mixed message to the public."
1988,gy2pr14,Just reduced operating capacity everywhere (for now).
1989,gy2pr23,"Of cos they wont lor. 

I still remember those fucks downplaying covid and their infamous ""healthy people don't need mask"" 

And they recently reallow cross country travel and wasnt fast to restrict people from India. 

Why do these people refuse to learn their lessons one , just cos they got all the money in the world and can afford the best medical service doesn't mean they should keep tempt fate le ... Bunch of fucks"
1990,gy2pr3s,Don't ask me I'm not millionaire minister ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

The current Phase 2 HR is just Phase 1 but almost everything is open (Closed being indoor mask off activities). In June 2020, phase 1, the following places were closed:
 
Museums, Libraries, Religious services and congregations, Cinemas, Theatres, Bars, Clubs and discos, Karaoke outlets."
1992,gy2prr7,Toilet roll supplies are still good. So it can't be a CB.

1995,gy2pt9c,Aiya I just booked my NS-FIT programme. Can I even go to that? Please SAF waive my ippt fr this year too  😭😭
1996,gy2ptet,"well.... that's precisely it. The inability to make tough decisions landed us right where we are.

We didn't make the decision and the decision was made for us with greater consequences."
1998,gy2pw8x,"I like how u wrote ""China created the virus"". I like to see an article so I can dwell on this conspiracy."
1999,gy2pw8z,"Yep, again exactly. Cases aren’t great, and you want to avoid them as much as possible but it’s the stress they put on hospital systems and subsequently death that are the problems, not the cases themselves. The case results have not been ideal, but also the testing is working to find them. It doesn’t feel to me  like we are in a position for this type of action."
2001,gy2pymd,I hope this is not true.
2002,gy2q00g,I support this.
2003,gy2q0uv,Same L2 this May I wonder if it would be cancelled welp

2005,gy2q2m4,breaking news: no crying
2006,gy2q2m7,This is bloody stupid. Households should be treated the same.
2007,gy2q2y7,"OK, how about I rephrase. The virus originated from China since cases were reported in China first since Dec 2019. But if you would like to believe that this never originated from China, then continue living in your bubble. 

The point I gave to the OP is that there is no point blaming countries, because people can rebut with “the virus originated from China.” And if it’s anything related to India, then our focus should be on OUR government by allowing open borders from highly infected countries"
2008,gy2q38v,"I feel like if we have to shut down over 150 cases, the healthcare system in singapore is shit. We had times when we had over 300 patients in hospital. The infection disease center alone has 300 beds iirc. Somehow our healthcare system got shittier in this 1 year"
2009,gy2q3y7,Is taking a taxi with 2 people considered a breach since the driver will be the third person?
2010,gy2q4gr,"Yeah, I think the delay was probably on purpose so the announcement would be after Hari Raya. And it's also in line with how the SG govt likes to ease measures in rather than make immediate changes. 

Interesting though, it might have been better to just impose a snap lockdown when the cases first started to climb. We'll have no way of knowing if that would have worked now though. Let's just hope the new measures are enough to curb the spread."

2014,gy2q9ox,"Vaccinations absolutely do stop cases, I don't know what you're referring to.

Yes, a vaccinated and immune person can still carry the virus and infect someone else. But if 70%+ of people in the street are vaccinated and immune, a lot more cluster branches would die off before they become super-spreaders. It would \_absolutely\_ lower the number of cases if 70% of the country was vaccinated."

2019,gy2qe7w,Then there will be no restrictive measures at all. So I kinda support this plan
2020,gy2qfjy,"honestly it doesn't help that one day, OYK says it's okay for them to come in through a third country since they would have quarantined there, only for them to release an article banning this practice and stopping entries from countries being used as a gateway in less 2 days. There is no consistency in their messaging and it gives people less faith in their ability and judgement."

2049,gy2r5fb,I dont think it will be as bad as last year. Companies have adjusted and pivoted their IT systems to support the sudden increase as well as policy changes and strategies to onboard new hires virtually. So shouldn't be as bad as 2020.

For Condos you have to check in, sign in with the guard and take temperature, cycle to whatever block it is (it can be really difficult to find), park the bike at some specially assigned area, look for the lift lobby, call the unit, wait 5 years for them to answer, look for the service lift because some condos dont want us stinky riders to pollute their precious resident lifts, take the lift up, then deliver. 

This is the worst case scenario, but delivering to any random condo takes at least 5-10 more."

The construction company(local or otherwise) would rather take profit first, rather than pay a livable wage, and in a very expensive country like Singapore, that narrows down the people willing to take up a blue collar job (construction or otherwise to almost none and with push in PMET positions, no one is left to take up the jobs and no one is willing, I suspect due to the ""unenviable"" nature of the job, besides the low pay). So who will build our flats? (still very expensive btw, 6 figures maybe 7 ).  Imported Help.  
The notion of minimum wage was shot down in discussions by unions, almost immediately when brought up. We get snubbed by saying that we rely too heavily, when the wage for a construction worker is way too low (in local context, not too sure about other countries.. although I suspect theirs have a form of minimum wage) .

Edit: A quick google only on construction jobs only returns those in the supervisory role, IMO what we need is locals that can replace those that are doing the actual labor."

Just because zero covid is impossible doesn't mean that you should stop trying to prevent it. Same with the flu or dengue.

Where's the link? The death to infection ratio does not provide evidence for the former sentence. It's like saying ""1+1=3, as evidence, this is my dog"".

It only tells us that people who were infected were less likely to die, which could come about from a variety of factors, like the demographics of those infected (dorm workers tend to be young) and the quality of our healthcare.

My point is that equating opening up with success in containing COVID is a really strange argument. I can be confident of scoring full marks in an exam because I studied hard for it but it doesn't mean zilch until results are out.  

The proof will be in the pudding to see if it breaks out again in 3 months, not immediately after the lifting of restrictions. That's short terminism. I'm not sure many health officials in the US really thinks opening up the mask thing is a good idea but it'll be an interesting watch. Fingers crossed it doesn't burst into flames and produce new variants like India.

It’s is medically shown that you can get vaccinated and still get Covid, only that your symptoms won’t be so serious and you don’t need hospitalisation. And hence, you won’t overwhelm the medical systems and hospital, leading to even more problems.

Countries like US/Israel are not opening up because they think they will no longer get Covid because of vaccination. They have simply accepted that Covid is here to stay, and people will continue getting it, but it will only be as serious as the seasonal flu. And no one shuts down anything for the seasonal flu since it does not overwhelm the medical system. Herd immunity helps to decrease the number of cases as well.

Those 5% you mentioned reinfected, they aren’t likely to overwhelm the medical system and will thus receive adequate care. And some would think it’s an appropriate trade off if it means livelihoods and business can continue in spite of reinfections. Here in SG, many families are going to suffer financially for the second time in 2 years because of this “CB”, when for the majority of the year we have done relatively well and kept deaths low. The cure shouldn’t be worse than the disease. Thorough vaccination is the only win-win that allows the medical systems to cope and for people to carry on with their lives too."

And yes, some people are alergic, some people can't take the vaccine. That's fine. But there's a huge difference between 22% in 6 months and the very realistic possibility of having had 90%+ by March.

But reality is often a balancing act between different people's expectations. Sometimes the couple want small banquets themselves but fighting the parents/parents-in-law is not a hill theyre willing to die on so they have to LLST. Sometimes they themselves like big parties and can afford it so why not let them be? 

There's nothing wrong with big or small banquets; different couples have different circumstances. Looking down on people who hold big banquets are just as condescending as those looking down on small humble celebrations.

All this is pandemic aside. Now cb-lite everybody please show your love in a socially distanced manner."
2314,gy30i1a,"Well, the gov't has said they're not making it mandatory so yes, it is up to people's wants. 

Why should a pandemic emergency state exist in the first place if not for the greater good of the people? The fact that there isn't a huge majority of people rushing for the vaccine is probably indicative to the government that the greater masses of people do not seem to desire being vaccinated. If the greater mass of people do not desire , then it's better for the people if they're not forced to"
2315,gy30kam,"It can't be more aggressive. We can only vaccinate based on our supply, this was why they vaccinated high risk groups then made it optional for everyone else.

Or let the younger people take them. Everyone I know has signed up and is desperately waiting but because we're all 35, we need to wait until June+. If your point is that ""people don't want"" then you are indirectly saying the government is doing a shit job, because I (and everyone else I know) WANT to take the vaccine. But the government, even with low fucking demand, isn't able to get it to me except after 6 months. FUck."

I mean if you want ppl to take the vaccine, tell them if you're vaccinated, you have no restrictions on gathering. you don't need to wear masks, you can dine in at restaurants. you can travel freely and come back without quarantining or shn"
2350,gy32g4m,"I completely agree that hospitalisations ought to be the yardstick.

However, the situation may not be so simple. This time last year, cases in the UK and USA had plummeted coming in to the summer . This was without vaccines. This year the same is happening - it is like deja vu.

The true test of the vaccines will come in the winter again -will there be a resurgence? Governments may lockdown again and then their excuse will be ""variants"".

2513,gy3voxl,"The optimal response to a pandemic from a health perspective will always look like it went too far. If you don't go far enough, the virus will outrun the protections.

Some different mindsets:

""Fuck it - who cares?"" - That gets you the US or Brazil

""Hey, our people culturally give each other lots of space to begin with. We'll just be a bit more careful and otherwise let people decide for themselves"" - Sweden

""The goal is to slow the spread enough to keep hospitals from becoming overwhelmed"" - Germany

""Let's focus on contact tracing, isolating exposed people as quickly as possible, and limiting things based on case loads and adjusting as needed"" - South Korea, Iceland

""If the virus is circulating at all, lock everyone in their homes until it goes away"" - China

There are demographic, cultural, density, available medical care, and other factors.  If you don't have herd immunity from infections or vaccines, if you let up just a little bit too much, it will break your ""defense"" eventually, and bodies will start piling up. If you wait for a major outbreak before restricting things more, it will be too late and the community transmission will take over.

How much lockdown is acceptable? I don't know. I'm not making a judgement. The math is very fuzzy. Some countries got lucky. Some didn't. There are places where 1 out of every 180 people have died from covid. I'm in the US, and I know multiple families dealing with deaths. My mother was hospitalized and is suffering from long term effects. I have a coworker whose best friend died from it - in her twenties. 

Singapore has not had a major outbreak in its most vulnerable population. They are trying to stop it from happening.

I'm not asking you to agree or disagree with someone else, but maybe that helps you understand why those actions are being taken. I don't think that there is a purely correct or purely incorrect answer.

On another note, the economic effects of lockdowns aren't directly correlated with the actions taken. Just because you keep things open does not mean that everything is normal. Oriole change their behaviors based on current risk levels that they believe. Even though Sweden didn't shut down, their economy still slowed down significantly. People traveled less, went out less, and shifted their spending. There is a correlation of restrictions to economic activity, but it is not anything like 1:1."

2580,gy4qdjc,"IMO 'CB 2.0' (because that's what it is, in all but name) is just a knee jerk reaction to SG's 'perfect' COVID record getting ever-so-slightly-tarnished. COVID is far worse in the UK, US, Europe, etc. and so many other countries. But, importantly, those countries recognise the necessity of getting the economy back on track, a fast vaccine rollout, and relying on that to navigate a return to normalcy. Hell, the UK has nearly the same proportion of its population fully-vaccinated as Singapore, with 2k+ cases per day, went through 3 lockdowns, and its COVID measures have pretty much ceased.

Sure, it will definitely be messy, and case numbers won't be in the single digits or zero, but trying to strike a genuine balance balance is far better than this current kiasu, all or nothing approach.Aiming for zero cases is foolish and frankly impossible to sustain. We have to learn to live with COVID-19 and accept the spikes as part of the price of opening up the economy and trying to return to normalcy. Jumping between the extremes of open and close is just unsustainable and irresponsible. Another de facto lockdown will be fatal to so many livelihoods.

And beneath all this, often neglected, is the cost to the mental health of thousands of people who will have to endure increasing social isolation because of an approach to COVID that is frankly way too high strung. I’ll hopefully live to see another day but I would hate to think of the thousands of others for whom this news will be fatal."

So Point 21:-

&gt;SPI-M-O is therefore confident that B.1.617.2 has a significant growth advantage over the UK’s currently dominant strain, B.1.1.7. The difference in growth rates  
between B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.7 is consistent with the former having a transmission  
advantage of more than 50%; this is based on observed growth that has already happened and it is unclear whether this same growth advantage would apply to sustained wider community transmission regionally or nationally. Resolving this question of the applicability of this growth advantage to the wider population will be difficult while the number of cases are small and relatively focussed.

There is evidently concern in UK that it will upset the planned relaxations, the next of which is due on Monday.  B1.617.2 is successfully spreading under Step 2 rules which include WFH, no indoor dining, masking and social distancing in retail, no indoor socialising between different households, limit of total of 6 from 2 households for outdoor socialising while the dominant strain isn't.  Over half of total population have had at least one dose of vaccine currently."

Besides right now it's not as if we are all mostly vaccinated. If we are like 90% (or some other high number, I'm just throwing numbers out my ass) then I would be more inclined to agree with you that **despite** a group of vulnerable not being able to be vaccinated, we should open up more.

What MoH needs to be doing at this point is telling us not how many 'cases' there are but how FEW of those who are vaccinated have become sick enough to need more than a day in bed and two panadol.   
The point of vaccination is not zero covid, the point of vaccination is that when you open up at a point most people are protected the disease is 100% going to spread but it's going to have little more effect than a miserable cold on 99.999% of people.   
We're probably not far enough ahead with vaccination at this point but there will come a time the stance of counting cases has to be replaced by counting people who are actually getting seriously ill. Or else there is no way out of this EVER."

From the fact that the vaccination centres are half-empty and have capacity to jab multiples of the numbers currently being inoculated. From the fact that every ministerial comment about this has said ""assuming supplies come in as expected .. ""  


The take-up rate currently massively exceeds the amount of vaccine arriving. Take up is not yet the issue, not even close, there just isn't enough of the stuff turning up to jab everyone at this point. We will get to the point that people need to be encouraged to get jabbed but we're months from there yet."

2708,gyacxqh,"I'm sorry but respectfully disagree, seems like you are assuming. No news article and facts on supply numbers.

 You are confusing supplies with the manner the vaccination program is being carried out and the takeup rate. And what the ministers are referring to doesn't indicate a current lack of supplies. Of course we all expect future flows to be on time.

Doesn't change my original comment and the fact that thus far, our vaccination rate lags behind some countries."

2715,gy2evg4,"&gt; # Only 2 visitors per household per day, no dining-in allowed: Covid-19 rules in S'pore from May 16

&gt; SINGAPORE - New measures were announced on Friday (May 14) by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, in the light of increased community cases.

&gt; They will take effect from Sunday (May 16) for a month to June 13. A review will be taken after two weeks to see if the measures need to be adjusted further.

&gt; The new measures are:

&gt; 1. Reduced group size from five people to two persons

&gt; The current permissible group size will be cut from the current five people to two persons. The cap of five distinct visitors per household per day will also be reduced to two distinct visitors per household per day.

&gt; In a statement, the task force said that individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than two per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place.

&gt; But grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not be counted towards the cap of two distinct visitors per household, or to the number of social gatherings per day.

&gt; However, the task force strongly encouraged grandparents to be vaccinated against Covid-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from infection.

&gt; To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households.

&gt; 2. Work from home as default for workplaces

&gt; Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so, the task force said. Those who need employees to return to the workplace should have staggered start times and flexible working hours for staff.

&gt; Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Meal breaks can be taken at the workplace, but staff should refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off.

&gt; 3. No dine-in allowed, among tighter measures for higher risk settings

&gt; Safe management measures are tightened for higher risk settings, such as when there is a high density of people who are without masks for a prolonged period.

&gt; All dining in will cease, including for hawker centres and food courts, indoors and outdoors.

&gt; Wedding banquets will have to cease. However, a special arrangement can be made for those with wedding plans this Sunday. They can proceed, but with required pre-event testing for all guests.

&gt; Food and beverage establishments will only allow takeaway or delivery.

&gt; Other activities which will also not be allowed include strenuous indoor exercise classes or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities.

&gt; Personalised services which require masks to be removed like facials and saunas, singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air like wind or brass instruments will also not be allowed.

&gt; But medical and dental services can continue.

&gt; 4. Reduced event sizes and mall capacity

&gt; Worship: Only 50 people are allowed at events without pre-event testing, and 100 with pre-event testing. This will apply to congregational and worship services. Live singing will be suspended during this time.

&gt; Malls: The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be further reduced from the current limit of 10sqm per person of gross floor area, to 16sqm per person. Odd and even date entry restrictions on Sundays for popular malls will continue.

&gt; Places of attraction: The operating capacity of attractions with approval will be cut to 25 per cent from the current 50 per cent. Indoor and outdoor shows can proceed with up to 100 people with pre-event testing, and 50 people without testing.

&gt; Museums and public libraries can operate with reduced capacity of 25 per cent.

&gt; Up to 100 persons may be allowed into cinema halls with pre-event testing, but only 50 are allowed without testing.

&gt; The same rule applies for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (Mice).

&gt; Weddings: Wedding receptions will not be allowed. Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with pre-event testing, and 50 participants without testing.

&gt; Funerals: The cap for attendees applicable to all days of the funeral, including the burial and cremation, is 20 persons or fewer, down from 30 persons currently.

&gt; 5. Enhanced testing

&gt; Antigen rapid testing (ART) will be given for all who present themselves with acute respiratory infection symptoms at the Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinics (SASH PHPCs), polyclinics, Emergency Departments and Regional Swab Centres (RSCs). This will be done together with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

&gt; The time from swab registration to notification of results is typically around 30 minutes for ART, but take up to 48 hours for PCR tests.

&gt; Both tests will be funded by the Government for all individuals with those symptoms.

&gt; This enhanced testing regime will be rolled out progressively, starting with around 200 SASH PHPCs that are already licensed as ART providers from May 15, and will be expanded to include all SASH PHPCs through May alongside polyclinics, Emergency Departments, and RSCs.

It is extremely difficult to conduct assessments via HBL, especially for the younger students. Hence, keeping school open allows the school to wrap up the testing and give parents an accurate report of their child

2) Quite a significant number of parents abhorred HBL when it rolled out last year, especially those with younger children. It was parents who had to be responsible in providing technical support for HBL, ensuring their children focused during eLessons, and that homework was completed.

On top of that, these parents had their own work to complete for their bosses. combined together, that's a fair amount of stress that I'm sure many parents do not want to revisit

3) By keeping schools open, parents have another 2 weeks to make arrangements for their children during the holidays.

Perhaps it's a lesser work schedule for the parents. Perhaps grandparents will become the main caretakers. Perhaps they will enroll the children in after-school care.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Taxis and private-hire cars can carry only up to two passengers during this period of tightened COVID-19 restrictions, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Sunday (May 16).

&gt; The restriction does not apply to passengers from the same household. For example, a parent can travel with his or her two children if they live together, LTA said.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Singapore on Sunday entered what authorities called Phase 2 (heightened alert), after a spike in COVID-19 cases in the community. The tightened restrictions will last until Jun 13.

&gt; In a press release on Sunday, the LTA said it is implementing some measures to minimise interaction and the risk of COVID-19 transmission during commuting.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; All commercial car-pooling services such as GrabHitch and RydePool, where drivers are paid for ferrying passengers while enroute to their destination, will be barred until Jun 13.

&gt; Non-commercial car-pooling trips are only permitted among friends or colleagues if the prevailing permissible group size of two people is adhered to, LTA said. For example, if a group of colleagues is travelling together, they must split into groups of not more than two.

&gt; LTA urged commuters to use taxis and private-hire cars booked through their respective ride-hail applications.

&gt; Members of the public who come across individuals providing illegal car-pooling services should notify LTA through the OneMotoring portal using the e-service, “Report Vehicle-Related Offences”, it said.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; It also reminded passengers that it is mandatory for drivers and passengers to wear masks at all times. Taxi and private-hire drivers should decline to pick up passengers who do not wear masks, it said.

&gt; “When travelling on public transport, commuters should try to spread themselves out or travel off-peak periods where possible,” LTA said. “They should also continue to adhere to the prevailing safe management measures such as maintaining good personal hygiene and refraining from talking. They should also see a doctor if they are unwell.”

The answer to your question is: yes."
2774,gyaj90z,Ty
2775,gyajyl6,So much confusion. I’m pretty sure there’s going to be plenty of misunderstandings when parents are going to try to board a cab in groups of more than two because not everyone is going to see these clarifications.
2776,gyalu6n,"I feel that the goverment now is not doing a good job in communicating the measures. In the past it was really easy: 5 people group, it doesn´t matter if they belong to the same household or not. This had a reason. How a SDA or police office should know if the group belongs to the same household or not? Shoould they ask anybody they see in larger groups? Police officer can check, but if what can the SDA do if you tell them ""we belong to the same household"". Nothing.

So, the measures are not going to be effective. We hear from the goverment ""you can only be in groups larger than 2 if you are doing essential activities"" and the Straits Times says in a Q&amp;A that you can do it if you are exercising or going to a park. WTF! Then indoor classes cannot, later indoor classes can if you are doing low activity (who decides what is low activity) if groups of two and wear a mask.

I feel that the communication and measures were clearer and better in the past. Groups of two means groups of two, not groups of two sometimes

So, no clear messaging of the rules not"

2784,gyarocl,Isn’t the point of household means under 1 roof as there is no point to social distance if you stay at the same place. If you live in different places you should not be meeting up/going out . You can be the same family but if you are living away from each other you should be considered from different households

2805,gyb664b,This makes no sense to me. Why limit number of passengers on taxis and PH cars if those rules also do not extend to public transport? Wouldn't the risk of transmission be much higher in buses and trains?
2806,gyb6b3n,I think these regulations apply only to taxis and PH drivers. Not privately owned cars as is your case?

&gt; Pre-schools and student care centres will remain open, while tuition centres should move activities online.

&gt; SINGAPORE: All primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, will shift to full home-based learning from Wednesday (May 19) until the end of the term on May 28, amid a rise in COVID-19 cases in Singapore.

&gt; This also applies to students from special education schools.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Announcing this on Sunday, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said authorities understand that the shift to full home-based learning ""may cause anxiety in some parents"".

&gt; ""But we want to assure all parents and students that MOE (Ministry of Education) will continue to extend our help and our fullest support to the schools, the teachers and the parents who require additional help to make these adjustments,"" he said.

&gt; 

&gt; “And we also want to put in place measures to continue to minimise the disruptions to the learning of our students.”

&gt; The decision comes after several primary school students tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, with most of the infections linked to tuition centres.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; At a media conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, Mr Chan noted that some of the new mutations of the coronavirus are “much more virulent” and “seem to attack the younger children”.

&gt; 

&gt; The B1617 strain appears to affect children more, said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, citing the ministry’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak.

&gt; ""So you will notice that for schools, the response has been different compared to say last year,” he added.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; During the June holidays, schools will allow graduating cohorts to return in small groups where necessary, and the mid-year GCE O- and A- Level Mother Tongue language examinations will proceed as planned, said MOE in a separate press release.

&gt; PRE-SCHOOLS WILL REMAIN OPEN

&gt; Pre-schools and student care centres will remain open to support families who need these services, said Mr Chan, although he encouraged parents to keep their children at home where possible since work-from-home is now the default arrangement.

&gt; Institutes of higher learning will reduce attendance on campus by converting more classes online where possible, except for essential in-person sessions like labs, practicals and final-year projects, said Mr Chan.

&gt; All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes should move activities online until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), he added.

&gt; “This is necessary to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of our students,” said MOE in its media release.

&gt; These measures will last until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert).

&gt; “Going forward, we must work on the assumption that now and then, there will be cases that will emerge in our community and perhaps in our schools. Thus far, we have no conclusive evidence of school-based transmission, we must never be complacent,” said Mr Chan.

&gt; “Going forward we will need a range of options in order to thrive in a COVID world, for us to continue learning and living in a COVID world.”

The first announcement was relating to dinning in as it was highlighted that the VJC student caught it at the food court. Dinning being a high risk activity as you can't wear a mask and eat. 

In the news just now, authorities revealed the cctv footage and found that the teacher and her students at learning point all obey safe distancing procedures and yet the students tio.

This show the Indian variant to be highly infectious. So much so that whatever safe distancing and mask wearing don't seem to prevent transmission."

2866,gybg7nt,Hate to admit but I must applaud cotton Chan. At least he is decisive. I really don’t think it helps if u only put selected schools on SHN when the virus is still spreading... might just as well close it all.

I understand that it takes time for schools to prep for HBL but why couldn’t this be announced with the rest of the measures that day? At least, even if HBL still starts on Wed instead of Mon, both parents and schools will have time to make preparations for those studying at home. I mean, we could all foresee the announcement coming over the weekend, but don’t just leave all the families in limbo over what to expect?!

If it is really needed, a snap and quick lockdown (inclusive of HBL) will be much better than a half-assed CB or Heightened Alert (whatever they want to call it). Yes, we may face economic problems due to such actions, especially those the government have justified why they wanted to keep borders open. But do we want Singaporeans to continue to suffer and languish in this Covid situation for longer? Understandably, we can’t expect to return to normalcy especially as we expect Covid to become endemic, without cases being normal. But when faced with a different and more infectious variant, we still need to take action. 

I’m just very frustrated by the actions of this government. We just need to understand that different circumstances will force us into taking different actions. I hope SGreans remember what they have done (or not done) in the next time we head to the polls."

Then, in order to salvage his tarnished image, he holds press conferences to prove to everyone that he is on top of things at his new job.

Whatever you do in health now, someone will complain. OYK is there for one day and people are already roasting him. CCS is meant to ascend to the throne.

And i can't say that i'm not upset that i took so much time.and trouble to try and keep my students safe and healthy, always nagging about hand washing , staying at home when sick and wearing the mask properly at all times, thinking that we were finally going to get clear of this virus......only to have all my hard work gone down drain thanks to the people who didn't even realise how important it was to keep the airport workers safe from a newer strain 😑."

They could be more capable and can communicate better, but frankly Ministry of Health is the hot seat. And Singaporeans please don’t be “used”. And manipulated. This is a very easy decision to make to close schools during school holidays. So please do not use this to judge CCS capabilities. Things would be different if he is in Ministry of Health now. He has always been the PM’a favourite and everyone now has fallen into the ploy to improve his image by giving him a role that is impossible to make mistakes since all the big education overhaul is already done."
2991,gyc1h5r,OYK isn't being roasted for being minister of health for one day. He's being roasted for being the person who allowed lax border control and protective measures in airports and allowing the virus to leak into the community.

It may be decided weeks ago to you, but looking at how things are implemented so last min and all over the place, I personally don’t think it’s been decided beforehand. Look like Teachers are not informed beforehand, and the fact that it’s only left 1.5 weeks before June holidays, it’s precisely the busiest period for Teachers honestly, with all the exams and going through papers, yet CCS still pushed for HBL at this juncture.

&gt; Pre-schools and student care centres will remain open, while tuition centres should move activities online.

&gt; SINGAPORE: All primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, will shift to full home-based learning from Wednesday (May 19) until the end of the term on May 28, amid a rise in COVID-19 cases in Singapore.

&gt; This also applies to students from special education schools.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Announcing this on Sunday, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said authorities understand that the shift to full home-based learning ""may cause anxiety in some parents"".

&gt; ""But we want to assure all parents and students that MOE (Ministry of Education) will continue to extend our help and our fullest support to the schools, the teachers and the parents who require additional help to make these adjustments,"" he said.

&gt; 

&gt; “And we also want to put in place measures to continue to minimise the disruptions to the learning of our students.”

&gt; The decision comes after several primary school students tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, with most of the infections linked to tuition centres.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; At a media conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, Mr Chan noted that some of the new mutations of the coronavirus are “much more virulent” and “seem to attack the younger children”.

&gt; 

&gt; The B1617 strain appears to affect children more, said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, citing the ministry’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak.

&gt; ""So you will notice that for schools, the response has been different compared to say last year,” he added.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; During the June holidays, schools will allow graduating cohorts to return in small groups where necessary, and the mid-year GCE O- and A- Level Mother Tongue language examinations will proceed as planned, said MOE in a separate press release.

&gt; PRE-SCHOOLS WILL REMAIN OPEN

&gt; Pre-schools and student care centres will remain open to support families who need these services, said Mr Chan, although he encouraged parents to keep their children at home where possible since work-from-home is now the default arrangement.

&gt; Institutes of higher learning will reduce attendance on campus by converting more classes online where possible, except for essential in-person sessions like labs, practicals and final-year projects, said Mr Chan.

&gt; All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes should move activities online until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), he added.

&gt; “This is necessary to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of our students,” said MOE in its media release.

&gt; These measures will last until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert).

&gt; “Going forward, we must work on the assumption that now and then, there will be cases that will emerge in our community and perhaps in our schools. Thus far, we have no conclusive evidence of school-based transmission, we must never be complacent,” said Mr Chan.

&gt; “Going forward we will need a range of options in order to thrive in a COVID world, for us to continue learning and living in a COVID world.”

&gt; SINGAPORE: All in-person private tuition and enrichment - whether academic or non-academic - for younger students will be temporarily suspended from Wednesday (May 19), according to an updated advisory from the Ministry of Education (MOE).

&gt; The suspension applies to both organisations and individuals who offer lessons to students aged 18 and below.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; This includes but is not limited to education and development support activities, arts and culture classes and workshops, religious classes, as well as sports and physical activity classes and programmes.

&gt; “The decision to suspend in-person classes is due to the higher risk of transmission of COVID-19 from the intermingling of students from different schools, and to avoid interactions between tutors and students,” said MOE on Tuesday.

&gt; From Wednesday until Jun 13, tuition and enrichment activities – including centre-based classes, home-based businesses and one-on-one classes – must either shift their lessons for students aged 18 and below online or suspend lessons altogether, said MOE.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The move comes after several primary school students tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, with most of the infections linked to tuition centres.

&gt; Singapore on Sunday announced that all primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, would shift to full home-based learning from Wednesday until the end of the term on May 28.

&gt; All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes should also move activities online until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing in a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference on Sunday.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Certain organisations are exempted from the temporary suspension, such as MOE-registered Foreign System Kindergartens and institutions that provide full-time pre-tertiary education to students age 18 and below that leads to a qualification.

&gt; Student care centres may also continue to remain open.

&gt; Those providing learning interventions provided by therapists registered with the Allied Health Professions Council, or Early Intervention centres funded by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) will also be allowed to keep their doors open, “subject to prevailing safe management measures”, MOE said.

&gt; These include strict safe distancing, health declarations, frequent disinfection of surfaces, staggering class timings and the wearing of masks.

&gt; Sport or physical activity classes for students aged 18 and younger may only continue outdoors, with a maximum of one instructor and one student at all times, MOE said.

&gt; Sport or physical activity classes involving more than one student are to be suspended.

&gt; FOR STUDENTS ABOVE 18 YEARS OLD

&gt; Classes catering exclusively to students older than 18 years old may continue in person, subject to prevailing safe management measures.

&gt; For centres that cater to both school-going children and adults, lessons for those aged 18 and younger should shift online or otherwise be suspended, while lessons for those above 18 years old can continue in person, said MOE.

&gt; MOE will also introduce further restrictions on indoor gyms and fitness/dance/exercise studios for those aged above 18.

&gt; Gyms and studios with classes for such students may remain open only if they offer low intensity physical activities.

&gt; Participants and instructors must be masked at all times and no single room should hold more than 30 persons, including tutors/instructors, the ministry added.

&gt; Outdoor exercise classes may continue.

&gt; Voice training and speech and drama classes for students older than age 18 may also continue, although the same restrictions – masks on at all times and a capacity limit of 30 – will be in place.

&gt; ALL STUDENTS

&gt; All in-person singing and wind/brass instrument classes are to be suspended until Jun 13, as this involves a higher risk of virus transmission due to voice projection or intentional expulsion of air, MOE said.

&gt; All indoor live performances scheduled to take place until Jun 13 are to be deferred/postponed to reduce the risk of transmission.

&gt; “Tuition and enrichment centres are responsible for ensuring that all safe management measures are implemented in their premises at all times. To ensure compliance, inspectors from MOE will be conducting inspections to check on the proper implementation of the safe management measures,” MOE said.

&gt; Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. For subsequent offences, they may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

3067,h1y4iup,"""Dining-in at food and beverage outlets is currently banned as part of Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) and was scheduled to resume on Jun 21, provided the COVID-19 situation remained under control.""...interesting use of ""was"" in that sentence."
3068,h1y4k74,"Haha, yeah quite annoying it got removed. No problem!"
3072,h1y4re7,"Paul Tambyah was right sia, measures are counterproductive!"
3073,h1y4tfs,"I don't think it can be compared that way, unless they ignore death rates and focus solely on the economy.

Other countries do not mind some people dying daily. Is Singapore ready for that now? If not now, moving forward?"
3074,h1y4uq3,"No. When New York had our current vaccination rate, they were essentially operating at our Phase 3.

Yesterday they opened 100% with 70% of the state receiving some form of vaccination.

We've some of the most insane restrictions given our case numbers, vaccination numbers and hospitalisation numbers.

It's double draconian at this stage in SG."
3075,h1y4vr8,I don’t understand how people in MOH’s Facebook comments could possibly desire another lockdown?
3076,h1y4vu5,Forever and always. Lawrence Wong making a strong case against himself for PM candidate come next cycle.

3079,h1y4xul,You sure it's cuz Ong Ye Can't have good things? I thought the travel bubble curse was more likely
3080,h1y4yo9,"I know UK has quite a sizable spike in infections again, despite their high vaccination rates due to the Delta variant. But even they still allow dining in, pubs open, groups up to 6 people, travelling and are even trialling large scale events such as football matches"
3081,h1y4yue,How so though? We don't get to choose. It's the pap cadre and the inner circle that decides.
3082,h1y4z53,And MOH facebook comments is the last place Id look to for important political decisions
3083,h1y4zdd,"Thankfully we haven't been desensitized to Covid deaths like many of the 'developed 1st world' countries. The US is opening up yes, but they had 389 Covid deaths yesterday, but from everything I see it looks like they're having a blast. It really makes sense given the experience they've been through.

Canada is also opening up and they had 29 Covid deaths yesterday.

We don't necessarily always need to be in step with what other countries are doing."
3084,h1y50e1,Fucking pussies. This is so ridiculous.
3085,h1y517d,Why please me lolol~! I'm not even a mod.
3087,h1y52nx,"Only so many crematoriums in Singapore hor. 

Otherwise, I suppose it's lucky we have a lot of trees by the roadside. Nparks can give special dispensation to use. /s"
3088,h1y53da,Different demographics. Reddit needs to realize that sg is made up of more ppl than just the ppl here. Ppl across different demographics have different considerations.
3089,h1y5420,MOH doesn’t make decisions off comments on their Facebook page…
3090,h1y54e0,They're often incompetent but not completely stupid. There's a reason the seat was all nice and fluffed for Chan Chun Sing until he put both feet in his mouth and they backed off. They know Singaporeans are apathetic but not infinitely so.
3091,h1y54i5,"Other countries have already “paid a price” (e.g. higher community infection leading to herd immunity and death rates), we have not. I think the fear is if we open up before a certain % of the population is vaccinated (prob 60-70% is my guess), we might have deaths that could have been avoided if these restrictions were still in place.

Good news is looking at the hospitalisation rates, the number requiring oxygen support/ICU is lowering down compared to last year (w/o vaccination), so we should still be on track to loosening them further. Question is when and how much."
3092,h1y54ni,Me and keenbum got same sentiments. Having me is like having him 🤣
3093,h1y54p5,Facebook is generally used by boomers nowadays. They have the lockdown sentiment
3094,h1y55h3,You can get the general sentiment of the public from there
3095,h1y55zj,"With evidence of 0.0017% death rate from covid amongst vaccinated people according to the cdc and younger people being less prone to ICU from covid, it is highly unlikely that there will be deaths. Especially since old people and healthcare workers that want to be vaccinated would have already been vaccinated long ago"
3096,h1y56zf,Haha still a while away. Singaporeans are a forgetful lot and ccs still has opportunities to open his mouth
3098,h1y58xc,Not my style haha. I just leave my bold alternative view and let ppl downvote.
3100,h1y5blw,"&gt; We've some of the most insane restrictions given our case numbers, vaccination numbers and hospitalisation numbers.


Or do we have low case numbers and hospitalisations **because** of the 'insane' restrictions in the first place"
3102,h1y5bza,"We have been desensitized by deaths due to dengue. We don't close schools, restaurants, gyms, KTV, lockdown blocks for that. There have been 32 deaths for dengue alone, more than covid. Yes I understand covid is contagious and maybe we have so little deaths due to the restrictions, but the population that was at most risk is now vaccinated or have been offered the vaccine already for a while now. The virus is not as dangerous to that group anymore. The virus is less dangerous to under 40s, which are now progressively being vaccinated."
3103,h1y5dsp,"A wise man once asked: ""When is this going to end Robbie?!"""
3104,h1y5ea3,So did reddit when we saw these numbers in early May.
3105,h1y5ejt,"Agree with this fully. I dont think most people are ready. Countries which are safe havens during covid pandemic such as Singapore, Taiwan, Australia are finding it very much harder to just open up and to accept the increase in death rate when we do so. Hordes of people blaming authorities for leaving our borders open which they felt lead to the second wave of infections."
3106,h1y5f5r,I'm tired Robbie
3107,h1y5gd8,Tbf I think it has probably been discussed internally but not released publically. They are probably fighting multiple fires within MOH and across the taskforce elsewhere. Prob no time to do comms to explain such things clearly when they are focusing on COVID related stuff.
3108,h1y5h32,"Maybe not, but it doesn't mean we aren't doing it better than other countries. Our death numbers are low and our stock market is doing surprisingly well this year too."
3109,h1y5hib,I wonder how many people are in ICU right now. Hope they can make a decision based on that
3111,h1y5iu0,"Dengue has similar mortality and typically way more severe symptoms. We had 138 dengue cases last week. At a certain point we just need to accept covid is sticking around just like dengue. LHL also said endemic, so can we start acting like it? Vaccination numbers won't go down, only up, so the situation can only get better from here. Why are we still fucking up our F&amp;B sector for little to no benefit?"
3112,h1y5lit,"&gt; We have been desensitized by deaths due to dengue. We don't close schools, restaurants, gyms, KTV, lockdown blocks for that.

Do you know how dengue spreads? Close Ktv for what?"
3113,h1y5m35,HOHOHO
3114,h1y5n56,Currently we are at 45% of first dose vaccinations. I think sg gov will only start opening up in earnest after it crosses 60% first dose
3115,h1y5o09,"Those data are from the ancestral or Alpha variant. The Delta one is likely worse due to its determined higher transmissibility.

I know it's frustrating, but remember that Singapore is dealing with the Delta variant, there are no viable data or examples to follow as of now.

There is much speculation from UK now that it has taken over Alpha, it remains to be seen what happens over there in a few weeks. Data from India is spotty at best.

Many experts are torn between how it will develop, so I think it's reasonable to be careful."
3116,h1y5ofr,I think 1 as of yesterday. 2(?) maybe? If there are changes.
3117,h1y5ofw,"&gt; They're often incompetent but not completely stupid

pretty low bar"
3118,h1y5or0,"Really meh? I'm not desensitized to deaths by Dengue, but now I'm thinking I might be ignorant to it. Do we really have that many?"
3119,h1y5oui,"It'll never end because the PAP has no political courage to end the restrictions and just let cases continue. When the gov't basically says I don't give a fuck if you're vaccinated or not, you STILL have to wear mask, you still have to undergo routine testing, isolation, etc, it's a clear sign they have no exit strategy because the vaccines obviously AREN'T the exit strategy like so many people hoped for."
3121,h1y5r8e,"Yes it's a fair point that needs to be considered that the nations with high vaccination rates also have high rates of Covid immunity (from people who already contracted the virus before), so that increases the % of people with Covid defenses. SG doesn't have that so our vaccination rate would need to be higher to open things up

That said, I think it's also quite a big leap to say that loosening restrictions will inevitably lead to more deaths. We're not talking about going back to pre-Covid, simply back to Phase 2 levels. And it needs to be emphasised that our vulnerable populations have largely been vaccinated already, so the risk of death is even lower. 

No doubt, it's an issue of risk appetite, and we're erring on the side of extreme caution, which is frustrating to me and many others, but I guess it makes sense to some."
3122,h1y5rc1,This lol.
3123,h1y5rf7,"Are our leaders too comfortable in their ivory towers and mansions and earning too much money, that they are so unnecessarily risk-averse lest they lose their diamond lobster bowls or something?

Do they not trust the vaccines they have bought?? 1/3 of the population has been fully vaccinated, and these consist of the most vulnerable segments of the population. Demand for vaccines for those who have not had the jab is very high because thankfully, most of us are believers of science, and so our vaccination rates will only go up by the day. These vaccines have also been shown to be effective against this Delta variant. So why still be so kiasi over something that is going to be endemic and will be part of our lives for a long time?

Leaders are paid more because they need to take more responsibility and risk, but it seems that if you get paid well regardless, because you give your own performance reviews, you don't really need to do your job. And the economic damage from keeping multiple segments of the country closed is ok because can just make another relief scheme and get the people to fund the reserves anyway. Collective responsibility and love for the country yeah? Well done, ministers!"
3124,h1y5ri0,I thought the point of not being a democracy was to be able to govern without having to resort to politician tactics...
3125,h1y5s2g,#NO WHY NOOO
3126,h1y5s5b,"Nah, numbers went up and down even during Phase2 HA. The current clusters didn't get infected during phase3HA since it's only been 3 days which isn't enough for the virus to incubate."
3127,h1y5srk,And how about governing with considerations driven by science and not by the vox populi ?
3129,h1y5txx,"Lol, don't expect one. The roadmap is whatever they pull out their ass. Even LHLs last address had no roadmap"
3130,h1y5u0j,"True, but ppl in NY were really tired of the Covid shit. They've really gotten desensitized to Covid deaths and their risk tolerance now is very different from ours, so I'm not surprised by the relatively different attitudes towards reopening."
3131,h1y5umb,"Pandemic fatigue is a thing, and that can't be stopped barring a full on lock down."
3132,h1y5uqq,"everyone vulnerable should be vaccinated, so are we supposed to not reopen because some anti vaxxer boomers ?"
3133,h1y5urs,They WFH and don't have social lifes
3134,h1y5uzv,Of course. I'm merely replying to why some ppl want to lockdown as per their comment above.
3135,h1y5vv0,GG
3136,h1y5w2l,Yah....ppl die daily in SG already from other causes
3137,h1y5x5q,"half of the population is losing it, but hey STI is doing well so all is fine"
3138,h1y5xnn,"And even TW got fucked eventually. They've been having deaths daily everyday for the last month. Otoh, they also count death from drowning as covid death so wtf knows man"
3139,h1y5xpc,Lol
3140,h1y5ybx,Or possibly if the seniors' vax rate steps up greatly. They've been stagnant around 70-75% (1 in 4 unvaxxed) for some time already.
3141,h1y5ywt,Haha looks like your worse case scenario is happening
3143,h1y5zty,Youngest dengue death last year was 20+. Youngest covid death was maybe 40+ last year and that was a dude who just dropped dead 1 mth after MOH pronounced him healthy. Dengue way more deadly imo to majority of people
3144,h1y5zxh,"Then gg already. We're forever no dine in and our entire night scene will be gone. No sports, no gyms. Nothing of any sort of norm.

Our SG endemic is mask forever, dabao always, zoom always. 

Jialat sia."
3145,h1y60dd,"I know, I am merely venting and adding to the frustration"
3146,h1y60p9,Probably the curse of both combined together to give us this.
3147,h1y61gg,They're middle-aged people and boomers who have had their share of enjoying their youth and now have a comfy home to stay in. Nobody's in their house telling them what they can/can't do of course they're okay staying at home
3148,h1y61kx,Quite surprising actually. I would think that they wanna go out actually.
3149,h1y62nn,"Idk man… might be unpopular opinion but feel that they are being too overly cautious. Not every country is the same but even countries like S Korea are opening up with lower vaccination rates. 

COVID clusters will definitely appear now and then, but to stop reopening even though vaccination rates are improving at a rapid pace, seems a bit counterintuitive. Don’t think it’s fair to put so much restrictions when vaccination greatly reduces the risk. Idk man.."
3150,h1y63t3,"If covid won't kill you, some of these measures will.

Dk how many business toh alr."
3151,h1y640g,"I think the exit plan is focusing more on the big picture (e.g. PM Lee’s exit strategy 2 weeks ago) and that is probably sufficient for most of the population. For MOH, I think they are hedging on explaining all the possible options openly given the situation is fluid and they don’t want to commit."
3152,h1y65it,"'cept dengue isn't person-to-person contagious. It's a poor comparison.

1 dengue case practically won't lead to 10 other cases, 1 COVID case *can* lead to 10 other cases."
3153,h1y65kr,Where do you have your stats on the attitude towards reopening in SG. IN my surroundings there are all for an immediate (full) opening.
3154,h1y65qh,"Dengue is vector borne so it doesn't really help whether we close these places or not. In fact it's probably worse if you close places like construction site as the spike last year suggests (stagnant water builds up without human intervention). There has been cases of long-term damage from covid infection. You probably won't die, but do you really want to roll the dice with this just to sing K?"
3155,h1y65qp,"I doubt it's a lack of time or focus, at this point, it's a deliberate choice to not address this in a more concrete fashion publically. Personally, this black box is my biggest point of frustration. We only hear: 'we have to be vigilant, we have to keep numbers down, we have to remain careful, calibrated, etc.' but nothing concrete. Other countries have clearly communicated which measures will be lifted once certain numbers/parameters have been reached. As to why the government is communicating this way, is only speculation. Could be they honestly don't know, they don't want to commit (and potentially backtrack later) or are being very conservative. So, here's to hoping this will turn for the better soon with rising vaccination numbers (and not even here, we get daily updates)."
3156,h1y66b9,"I think once vaccinations hit a certain threshold, they will reopen because at that point, the chance of hospital system being overwhelmed will reduce to an acceptable level."
3157,h1y679w,"Man, I know gyms which are already suffering. What fucking nonsense is this? You have masks, you have social distancing, you have vaccines and this retard can't decide when is enough?

Last year, most F&amp;B and gyms already had to suck up 2 mths worth of CB. Now this year, PAP already made them suck up 1 mth, maybe even longer. Tell me how many businesses can run on being semi-closed for 1 or 2 months out of 12 year after year"
3158,h1y67qs,"Well it's not gonna go up right? Those who want to get it would have gotten it already, at this point the remainder just don't want or are unable to get it. Should we continue locking down for them?"
3159,h1y67tk,On one hand said covid19 is endemic now and going forward the focus is not going after every infected cases but on the other hand so concern about the number of cases and it is likely that dining in on Jun 21 is off. Let's see.
3160,h1y68fn,"Knn.

So slow to plug the gap to stop the *Delta* variants, so quick to restrict locals.

Fuck you lah LW. Do better."
3163,h1y6a09,"It'll end when Wong and the fucking MTF goes away. Seriously, bunch of trash"
3164,h1y6bj9,"This is such a maliciously misleading comparison. New York state has two *million* cumulative cases and fifty thousand reported deaths. The actual case count is surely higher than that. The impact of that level of infection on herd immunity thresholds is absolutely massive. They are reopening because things improved from ""disaster"" to ""manageable"", and because their expectations and experiences are in a completely different context. You can't take two places with such vastly different circumstances and compare one single metric to prove your point.

FWIW I even agree with you - I think we should be well on our way towards reopening. But why misinform people with bad stats?"
3165,h1y6bu3,Probably jealous of young people actually having lives
3166,h1y6ciw,"Lol, you think so? I don't think our gov't believes in the vaccination. What can you do as vaccinated? You still wear mask, you still have to undergo routine testing if you're in F&amp;B or migrant worker every 2 weeks, you still have to isolate and quarantine or hospitalise. It's like I'm sorry but I don't think the govt believes the vaccine works or they'd at least have gotten rid of the testing for vaccinated people"
3167,h1y6co6,"Yeah it's a poor comparison. There's no dengue vaccine. On the otherhand nearly 50% of the pop has received the first dose of covid vaccine and the most vulnerable segment is fully vaccinated. And this percentage will only continue increase, probably quicker than ever since this is the first week that it's fully open to all Singaporeans. The chance of covid being able to overwhelm our healthcare system at this point is basically 0. Most people who get it now may not even realize they're sick.

edit: ok so there is a dengue vaccine. Still, my point stands. We're not being pushed to take dengue vaccine despite it being more severe and similar case count. Many of us are vaccinated against covid and many more will be soon."
3168,h1y6d3j,"At least last year got stimulus package for businesses.

This year they don't shut them down on pretence to not give any money because businesses essentially nvr shut down.

They really playing all the SMEs/F&amp;Bs"

Pretty sure there's a number of seniors like him too."
3176,h1y6htr,We're not supposed to open because some people may die /s
3177,h1y6i2k,"Also, I haven't watched any of these MOH/LW/OYK press conferences, but does the media push back at all on the govt's conservative stance (""No other country with such a high vaccination rate maintains this level of restrictions. Why do you feel it is necessary"" etc), or asks for more clarity on a roadmap/exit strategy (concrete vaccination rates to remove capacity limits/mask mandates, etc)?"
3178,h1y6j7f,"It's relative. Yes some of us are excited and some of us are lukewarm, but we're nowhere as desperate as folks in NY (I speak to my colleagues there pretty much every single day and they're all in crazy party mode now)."
3179,h1y6k7k,Lockdown Sentiment.... Great name for a band
3180,h1y6kzt,FOMO eh? Glad it sometimes works out
3181,h1y6lpl,That's because not enough people are vaccinated. A vaccinated person can still be a vector and pass the virus on to an unvaccinated person who may end up requiring hospitalization.
3182,h1y6mvx,"Hopefully he manages to get his, I totally understand there are seniors like your dad who wants but are unable to. My frustration stems mostly from my parents who want only SinoVac."

3188,h1y6pep,"because op already posted something else in the also few hours, some rule apparently"
3190,h1y6s7q,"But the number of people infected with covid before is alot higher hence they are kind of immune to covid. Everyone comparing with what other countries are doing. Did we forget how high their death toll was. Why not take a step back and see what's going to happen to them first.

If they succeed and the covid numbers remains stagnant + no new covid wave, then we can open ourself up too. Gov take care problem. No take care also problem. Very problematic."
3191,h1y6shv,I fucking know right. Can he just shut the fuck up for once
3193,h1y6t94,"And even then they may still spread it to other vaccinated people

Vaccinated people still get hospitalised. 10 out of 29 deaths in UK to delta have been vaccinated people"
3194,h1y6tmb,Fuck y’all fr I booked my HDL reservation already
3195,h1y6u67,This is RIDICULOUS.  Singapore needs to get it's economy going again - the number of severe cases are at near zero and vaccines rates are rising daily!  Let the country open!!
3196,h1y6ujj,No timeline just vibes
3197,h1y6ujm,"Singapore has an extremely huge fetish for case numbers for some bizarre reason. Cases should not matter in any way, its only hospitalizations and deaths. And with a vaccine program where everyone is eligible, and especially every single vulnerable group has been able to receive the vaccine for months now there is absolutely no way we should be thinking about going backward.            
Texas had a full reopening when they only had 7% of their population vaccinated, and sure they had some early deaths but very soon started having days where they had 0 deaths, and even on the days with deaths, the vast majority of them had anyway occurred among the unvaccinated.            
The only real benefit we would get over achieving 0 covid at this point is maybe forming some travel bubbles, which anyway seems to not be going too well. We should just focus on a full internal reopening and opening up to the rest of the world in a proper manner."
3198,h1y6ut3,"I am especially puzzled with the TT. With the mandated use, and the citizens giving up their privacy for the good of the nation, still having unlinked cases.

Combined with the vaccination rate, we should be sailing through to scheduled reopen date."
3199,h1y6uuw,"How to continue giving stimulus? Last year was what? 100B iirc? You can't keep giving 100B every year,  or even 50B since not everything closed this year"
3200,h1y6uxj,"Well right now we have similar vaccination rates to much of Europe, but theyre doing pretty well with a fraction of our restrictions, why not relax the measures?"
3201,h1y6vfb,yup. GG until your parents die. Later blame gov. Say why gov why. Nang bo ti nang que bo ti que.
3203,h1y6x4n,"There is also the issue of prioritisation (e.g. if we are to have further lockdowns, what do we need to do). For the MTF, they can either focus on explaining what is the exit strategy or working on ways for them to ensure a lockdown without making ppl suffer economically (e.g. wage and rental support). Add that to the usual stuff that MTF members have to do (their day to day civil service jobs), then the issue of communicating the strategy to the public becomes less of a priority internally (esp if they have mapped out one within the MTF). 

I think like most people, I am also quite sick and tired of these restrictions. But I feel we have to see the issue on multiple sides, esp since most people in government (i.e. civil servants) are just doing their jobs."
3204,h1y6xh3,"SG is the only country pushing for ppl to vaccinate WHILE acting as if vaccination doesn't work. This is why nobody has ANY incentive to vaccinate.

Fully vaccinated ppl still are subjected to mass test, quarantine, swabs, blood test all that nonsense."

3214,h1y76u3,"My question will be what is the endgame the government have in mind if they decided to delay the reopening.

What if the Bukit Merah View cluster did not happen last week, but happen after 21 Jun 2021? Are we going to reverse the decision to allow dine-in from 21 Jun 2021. If not, why should we delay the reopening plan on 21 Jun 2021 now. Just because it happened before 21 Jun 2021?

Whatever the decision, the government need to communicate their plan clearly and unambiguously. Leaders are elected to make difficult decision, not to ""feel their way around look-see, look-see""."
3215,h1y76ue,"Yesterday night press release specifically mentioned someone who frequented the FC catching it. I think it is the first case of this happening at a FC. So it does seem quite serious.

&gt;Detected through surveillance:

&gt;Case 64229 is an 87 year-old male Singaporean who is a retiree. He frequently visited 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View. He developed a fever on 13 June and sought medical treatment at a polyclinic the next day, where he underwent both an ART and PCR test. Both test results came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day. His serology test result is pending.

They didn't mention anything about the following case, so I am not sure if he caught it just by going to the market:

&gt;Case 64239 is a 72 year-old male Singaporean who is a retiree. He developed a cough and sore throat on 13 June and sought medical treatment at a GP clinic on 14 June, where he was administered both an ART and PCR test. His ART result was negative for COVID-19, and he developed a fever on the same day. His PCR test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 15 June. His serology test result is pending. Case 64239 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 22 May, and the second dose on 12 June.

It’s not going to go away, the virus will never leave us. So what? We stay inside and wither and die? We never touch another human being for as long as we live? Endemic to them means what? What is even the point of vaccinations then. None of this makes any sense, the rest of the world opens up and lives like normal human beings again and we are forced inside with only a few hundred cases and literally like two people in ICU.

3224,h1y7ckt,"they are. I somehow doubt they kept to the 2 people limit as well.

In a way, we are using taxpayers' money to keep SIA afloat and how long does the govt want to keep slap band-aid on the aviation and the tourism sector? Whats the point of attracting MNCs over when we keep increasing our border control, even for vaccinated travelers. They cant even send their execs over to start the ops without 21 days quarantine. Now is the time where they stand firm and announce ANY form of roadmap of opening and give hope to the nation. We dont need anymore vague messages with no concrete plans, we are really tired."

We were lucky our major outbreak happened in a population comprised of largely younger, healthier people, if not our death toll would've been far, far worse. There were people who sounded the alarm bells on that too before shit hit the fan. 

But yes, it's a question of risk appetites. No doubt it was the right choice to be more risk-averse last year, with so many unknowns. The point many of us are making here is that a big chunk of the population is vaccinated, including a majority of the vulnerable populations. It is very, very unlikely we'll see residents dropping dead like flies. Risk appetites get adjusted all the time based on the changing environment. I think it is reasonable to do so now."

The older folks were vaccinated in SG like &gt;2 months ago.  The most vulnerable population is protected.

If SG just opened up 100% people would get sick and die (that’ll happen regardless as the vaccine isn’t 100% effective) but the biggest risk of overwhelming the hospitals is gone.

I mean, the US had 80,000 people die of the flu back in 2018 and nobody batted an eye or took any protective measures other than a flu shot (which wasn’t that effective that year).

No no in fact the government's approach to this is so business-centric that they want to lock us down now to show that they will take drastic actions the moment cases go up.

Australia, before the various outbreaks, had sports events with stadiums full of people, no masks, actual clubbing etc. The only reason why they haven't loosened things is because their vaccination rate is very, very low. I am 99.99999% sure that if they had our level of vaccination, it would be back to pre-Covid days for them, with the only exception likely to be some border controls.

As for China - same story. Low vaccination rates (and of course, the efficacy of those vaccines is another issue altogether....)"

In best case scenario they get something, but no government support ever matches the amount you make running the business.

3404,h1yawnu,"Is there a corresponding spike in hospitalisations, deaths? (and yes, I fully recognise there could be a lag between case spikes and hospitalisation/death spikes) From what I am seeing, no.

If so, what exactly is the concern here? We want to minimize the number of people getting sick? Ok, fair enough. But at what cost? 

It's fair to say that one is happy to sacrifice some things (e.g. some hurt to the economy, mental health issues for others) for others (absolute minimization of potential deaths, even though it has been minimized already with vaccines, prevention of hospitalizations etc). 

But i think the point is, at the stage Singapore is in re: vaccinations and case/hospitalisations/deaths numbers, it is worth debating where the risk appeitite should be at. It is not clear-cut that where the govt's stance is right now is the 100%, no-doubt correct one."

3419,h1ybfhc,"there's no specific data on your questions, but you can refer to the BBC article for the full points. A few key things

&gt;Most severe cases were among unvaccinated people or those who had only one dose, he said, adding that at current rates nearly 10 million second doses could be administered over four weeks to increase protection.

Our full vaccination % is currently sitting only around 30%.

Younger and in SG's case, the age group who have yet to be fully vaccinated are also contributing a higher % of those being hospitalised.

&gt;However, NHS England data shows over-55s are continuing to account for a smaller percentage of people admitted to hospital with Covid-19.

&gt;On 6 June around a third of admissions were aged 55 or over, compared to a little over 70% on 6 March, and more than 80% on 6 December. 

So yes, I think i'd trust the opinions of the UK medical body than the sentiments of r/sg"

3428,h1ybmma,"I know, I referred to the same article too but unless we know what's the definition of ""creep up "" it's hard to say or quantify what that means in the local context.

All this from the very same article you linked so you gotta consider everything as a whole"

3438,h1yc4ka,"Ok firstly there is no need for the condescension of “I’d trust professionals over Reddit commentators”

I mean, if that’s your stance, why are you even on this platform anyway? Nobody is saying, “trust me on this!” We are just having a debate, which is... the point of Reddit? 

Also, slight side note but even “professionals” get it wrong from time to time - see: the infamous WHO and its early reccs on not masking when you’re not sick.

Secondly, I’m not really sure what exactly your point is? That we should be cautious in spite of high vaccination rates? OK, we ALL agree w that. The question is HOW cautious we should be. The UK, as you will note, with its high vaccination rates, has “restrictions” that are quite a bit looser than what we have currently. They are delaying loosening even further, not tightening. So that’s the professional opinion of the UK medical body, as put into practice by the UK govt, I suppose? 

Again, NO ONE is saying go back to pre-Covid days. The debate now is abt restoring dining-in at restaurants ala Phases 2 or 3. Is your point that even the UK medical body would disagree w that? Appreciate some clarification."

3455,h1ycokg,Don't forget that you can only get early protection 12 days after your first shot. We should compare the vaccination numbers from 2 weeks ago to know the number of protected people.
3456,h1ycp4g,That's always going to be the problem with basing policies on minimizing risks. The risks can ALWAYS be minimized depending on what you're willing to give up and our govt is very willing to give up the liberties of the citizens.
3457,h1ycrb9,"**Not all vulnerable groups are vaccinated.**

There are also significant numbers of “young” people with pre-existing medical conditions that can put them at excessive risk of complications, which vaccines help to protect.

One dose isn’t enough also. Since there’s a one month gap, it is still too far away to vaccinate all vulnerable people. The young at-risk group only just got their sms, which means earliest to have them protected is around 1.5 months away.

If anything, blame the government for giving no fucks to people with pre-existing medical conditions. They could have prioritise them in advance and get these at-risk individuals protected too, but they just forget that not all young people are extremely healthy fit people.

Its not like we didn’t have enough vaccines 1-2 months ago to add these people onto the priority list.

With some conditions like asthma having a prevalence of 5% in adults and 20% in children in SG, this is not a small group either. Tens of thousands of people.

Edit: so much for empathy. People care so much about their needs they don’t care about others. I’m not even saying that we should not open up soon, I’m just saying we have failed to quickly protect vulnerable groups we have forgotten about. But since that is an inconvenient obstacle to the “everyone who is at risk is vaccinated can open up liao” narrative, who cares right?"

A large number of exec already packed and went home. They also removed the LOC for DP, which means that the wife/husband of any exec in Singapore can no longer work here (Unless they get an EP and for that good luck with quotas and minimum salaries and such). This means that any exec coming to Singapore has to assume that their wife/husband will not be able to work and has to request an extra 40% in Salaries to justify the move! (In my case, it means a loss of significant income to stay in Singapore). You add this to the point mentioned in your comment, and the fact that vaccination rates do not offer re-opening visibility, and this is starting to be a real deal-breaker.  This is getting so bad we are considering shutting down the Singapore company. We are giving it until the end of the year, but if Singapore does not go back to the business friendliness we opened here for, you will have a wave of MNC relocating elsewhere."

as if you didn't fuck up when you let some of our frontliners getting the Indian variant without proper protective suits and borders open big big to our South Asian ""friend"" back in April.

3568,h1yibdd,"Pardon my crude way of putting things but unfortunately that is essentially the question this entire thread is questioning about. Many countries are reopening although people are still dying. They have accepted that there’s is a trade-off between lives and livelihoods.

We like to think that every additional death is one too many. But I think more considerations should be made for all the potential lives that can be saved from earlier detection of cancer or other ailments amongst the middle-aged, or the suicides arising from depression amongst the young, who have many many more fruitful years ahead of theirs. Or for preventing the retrenchment of any more adults, which has social implications. Of course, we shouldn’t go all reckless and overwhelm the healthcare system, but some risk taking will need to be involved if we do not want to stay in this state for the decades to come.

Also, eventually as we near herd immunity, if you don’t vaccinate out of choice, the vaccinated should not carry the added burden of restrictions because of your choice. You choose not to vaccinate, you die, your problem. At the end of the day, this virus is here to stay, and one day in the future the restrictions will loosen however it goes. It begs the question:

I wouldn't be surprised if random privacy-crazy person starts grumbling about how they're _forced_ to declare their vaccination status just to go about their activities.

But it'll also mean that people who took their vaccinations overseas (e.g. tourists) would need to get _their_ vaccination status registered into our database, or that someone develops a framework that individual shops can use to recognise vaccinated people."
3626,h1ymh04,"&gt; I am especially puzzled with the TT. With the mandated use, and the citizens giving up their privacy for the good of the nation, still having unlinked cases.

Then, what's the point of vaccination then? Aggressively rolling it out, yet, no concrete plans for the future? What's the point of vaccinating everyone when the leaders are still stuck with the ""Uptick in case counts = increased restrictions""?

COVID is here to stay. Period. Whether you like it or not. COVID zero is NOT going to happen. Period. If you want to treat the virus as endemic, you'll have to start seeing beyond case counts. You'll have to start seeing hospitalisation rates, patients needing icu/oxygen support, death rates. And that's exactly what the vaccines are for. To reduce death, hospitalisations and severe symptoms. To ensure our medical system and institution DO NOT become overwhelmed. That's how we must be to treat COVID as endemic.

Not some flip-flop half-hearted restrictions. Wtf man. It's been almost a year and a half. The citizens are tired. Give us proper, concrete plans FFS!"
3628,h1ymj94,I'm gonna cry
3629,h1ymp8g,"&gt; Yes, which means if we open up, and there is an outbreak, it can be contained fast since TT can trace pple's whereabouts.

3632,h1yn40b,I agree with your sentiment; that being said the original commentator argued that the govt should give incentives for those who are vaccinated.

3654,h1ypom4,"Death is a sensitive topic, but I think it is important to not shy away from such questions and statistics which can unfortunately dehumanise the deceased. Because these are the questions that we inevitably have to ask, as we reopen more.

Personally, if I have to sacrifice my life to rescue the dozens of youths from the brink of suicide, the hundreds of middle-aged people out there from premature deaths, and the thousands of individuals and families who have been torn apart by the pandemic, I would. If I have to sacrifice my life so that people can go back to clubbing and concerts again and enjoy their lives to the fullest, I would.

This unfriendly foreign investment and talent policies will at some point become problematic.

The UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) has been studying and modelling the delta variant, the latest paper is here:

[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spi-m-o-summary-of-further-modelling-of-easing-restrictions-roadmap-step-4-9-june-2021](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spi-m-o-summary-of-further-modelling-of-easing-restrictions-roadmap-step-4-9-june-2021) \- check out page 3 for the breakdown between 1 and 2 doses of AZ and Pfizer/Moderna, it's quite interesting!

Short and medium term projections are also made for the variant. These are modellings though, and you see the difference between the different universities as they use different assumptions. Nevertheless, these few weeks will be interesting.

Read elsewhere that the problem is that UK has 2/3 on AZ and the rest on Pfizer/Moderna, if we compare UK with Singapore that uses mRNA vaccines only, we should fare better in terms of dealing with the delta variant. They are encouraging the 2nd dose to be mRNA now in the UK, even when the first dose taken is AZ. Hopefully that will help them.

And the government isn't not following the science, similar been shared previously by LW on his FB back on 23 May - [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses)

&gt;  
&gt;In total, 383 people in England were admitted to hospital with the Delta variant over that period – 223 of whom tested positive for Covid before turning up at A&amp;E – with 42 having had two doses of the jab, 86 having one dose and 251 unvaccinated.

Also unlike many other countries, we have the delta variant to contend with as the dominant strain, and we don’t know exactly how transmissible or dangerous it is. It won’t be fair for children or the young to die just because they can’t be vaccinated yet. 

The vaccination rate to reach herd immunity to reduce the rate of reproduction to less than 1 has been often cited as 70%. And that was with base covid, not the variants. We’re simply not there yet. Glad that as a country with the resources, we have the luxury of holding out for a month or two to wait for the vaccination rates to increase."

For example, even if we allow dine-in from 21 Jun 2021 as planned, food business will face a decision on how much order should they placed for supplies and without a clear criteria of when and how the government may disallow dine-in again, this will increase risk for small businesses. 

For business who have already placed orders for new supplies with higher demands expected on and after 21 Jun 2021, if the decision is taken to delay allowing dine-in, the loss from the orders already place will only be accrued to the stall owner."

This one is an unfortunate problem. To protect them, it is crucial that we get enough people vaccinated so that they can benefit from the herd immunity. Hopefully with more varieties of vaccines available, there will eventually exist one which they can use.

Also, my loved ones are fully vaccinated at this point in time, so hopefully that helps. In fact, I was the last one who got vaccinated, awaiting my second shot now. It’s just that my family is pretty small, and we kinda lost contact with most of the relatives of the extended family."

Currently if you try to book, you can get your Moderna vaccine done the very next day. But if you choose to wait for Pfizer, you would have to wait till end July for first dose and mid September for second dose.

If they give an incentive for ppl to take vaccine asap, I'm sure those who booked Pfizer will instantly change their appointment to Moderna."

3706,h1yxf0q,"Earlier part of your argument sounds like Whataboutism to me, which has little to do with what we are facing. We should continue, and are continuing to fight cancer. Is there evidence of that many more suicides among the youth due to social restrictions that are happening now?

I think it’s easy for the statement to be made that life is useless if you can’t go dining at McDonald’s when we are in this fortunate state now, in Singapore, rich country with deep pockets and few deaths and cases. Would you make the same argument if it’s your mom or dad in hospital on life support?

This isn’t just to tug at heart strings. There’s a level of difference in risk acceptance in say, allowing people to drive vehicles when plenty more people die from automobile accidents in a year than COVID deaths in Singapore vs what we are doing now. Dining in at restaurants and going clubbing aren’t needs. Driving vehicles is necessary and even life saving.

If analogy can be made, it’s perhaps with say, cigarette smoking. We do allow smoking to exist in Singapore and it does kill people, and I’ve lost a loved one due to cigarette smoking. Is the allowance of smoking so critical that without it, life is meaningless? Well… my loved one regretted smoking on his death bed. I applaud Singapore’s stance to restrict smoking to do its best to reduce the chances of non-smokers getting cancer from others who smoke.

So similarly, I applaud Singapore’s (and others) stance at social restrictions to prevent needless suffering and deaths, when there’s plenty more to life than dining in and concerts. Life can be celebrated even during lockdown. I don’t know about how you’ve been living the past year+ we’ve been on lockdown, but I’m genuinely happier now than 2 years ago before COVID happened. I’m an extrovert too. Sure, I miss my poolside parties, clubbing, BBQs, camping, etc. But I’ve also learned the past year+ that I can celebrate life doing other things too."

When they freak out like how they do over daily double digit cases, it implies to them only 0 or low single digit daily numbers are acceptable. But given that Covid is going to be endemic,  there'll always be new variants popping up *and* multiple instances have shown that fully vaccinated people can still get infected, it just seems ridiculous if they continue to expect these low rates in future when SG opens up or loosens restrictions. 

I've quite a few friends and relatives running small businesses and it is really grim. 

Meanwhile you get some boomers taking cues from the government and acting like the world is going to end because we got something like 15 cases in a day.

And the last group of the population only just started the vaccinations this week."
3756,h1z4w9t,"Your concerns is valid. Much of it is real concerns. *Though I think you may want to tone down a little on your Singapore exceptionalism.*

We won’t know the exact number of teens who died from suicides in 2020 until later on in August when statistics on it comes out, but I can tell you that there’s way more suicidal thoughts in r/SGExams these days than just 2 years ago.

Still, we do know that surgeries have been postponed out of an abundance of caution, to prepare for a surge in Covid cases which never arrived. Overreacting is bad. Each time this happens, valuable time that could be used to remove Stage 1 tumours is lost as it festers to Stage 2. There will be people who will die earlier because of this in the long term, as many news sites from other nations report.

While life can be celebrated through new means which have happened since a lockdown, let’s be real. Deep down, we know these aren’t sustainable long-term, complete substitutes. Maybe you are happy. I was also very happy initially, during circuit breaker, because I don’t need to go to school! But as time goes on, you start to lose even more perception of a separation between work and life. Time just whiz by. There’s increasing talk about languishing. Is everyone really happy with that?

Once again about your Singapore exceptionalism. Our way is a great way, but it is not the best way. Admittedly, there are no best ways, but we shouldn’t blind ourselves to how other countries are handling it. While you applaud the fact that we had avoided needless deaths through our harsh measures, which amount to 5 this year, also remember there are countries with vastly different pandemic control philosophies which are still doing better than us. Australia hasn’t got a death in 2 months, and before that, the previous death was last year. We have 3 more than them. All this which they did without mask wearing in many occasions, and with massive gatherings. Not to say that if they can do it, we can, for they implement snap lockdowns each time they see 4 cases, and we are more vulnerable to global traffic, and we have the Delta strain. But I’m just putting it here so that you know that our approach is not necessarily the only shining beacon for the world to follow.

Indeed, we must be cautious to prevent another Malaysia or Taiwan from happening, but not too overly-cautious to drain the mental energy of civilians, who are increasingly revolting in ways that is threatening the social fabric of our country. If people aren’t so sensitive to case numbers, talks about xenophobia and racism wouldn’t have erupted to this extent today.

Hence, I do agree somewhat with you that we haven’t reached a stage where I think we are safe to fully reopen. But as we approach herd immunity for vaccination, I hope a reopening of an extent much further than Phase 3 takes place. When that happens, deaths will be inevitable, but life has to go on. Otherwise, what’s the point of all these measures? The longer this lasts, the more people will revolt in extents worse than now from the insanity that Covid brings."

i think SG is just being overly cautious of the potential of another outbreak and subsequently CB round 2. can’t blame them, though i agree that 0 covid is practically impossible to achieve right now."
3764,h1z5kc3,"I am not referring to borders. In my case, government ask me to close my KTV more than a year ago. Now they ask us to pivot to F&amp;B, and we are barely scraping by, being ill-adapted to compete in F&amp;B space. 

Then now they completely shut us down with no solid timeline for re-opening. And the landlord is extremely pissed with me already.

If they had let us temporarily open up while cases were 0-1 for weeks, we would not be in this lousy situation right now."
3765,h1z5wq0,"Ok yes, I was referring to the 'City of New York' not the state. However having said that, they report covid numbers by the city too and the city has had 3310 cases over the past 2 weeks which averages out to 230+ daily cases. still 10 times more than our daily cases with the **city** of new york only have 1.5x times our population. And I use them because of the similar profile and population density. 

It's slightly better reading but do you seriously want us to reach those levels? And like the other guy said, your understanding on vaccinations and comparing it to the 'common flu' and other infectious diseases are misguided at best and insidious at worst. I used to not be able to take zombie movies seriously because i always thought people wouldn't act that way in real life but covid has really opened my eyes to the mindset of people."

I'm on this platform the same reason I thought everyone here is, for discussion. But clearly i'm mistaken because the echo chamber is far louder than I ever remember. But i've come on and have my mind changed on here before on these matters. I seriously doubt many of you can say the same.

So because professionals got it wrong once before therefore we're not to trust them again? What kind of slippery slope argument is that? They have constant revision of their work and the fact that they are able to access the evidence and change their stance is proof that their processes work and why I would trust their opinions over the flavour of the day sentiment in the reddit echo chamber.

My point is simple. That we should be using other countries as a case study on reopening up. By all counts, UK ticked all the right boxes in approaching the covid since the start of this year and yet their cases are rising back up, and somehow our govt should ignore that and make the same mistakes they did? We didn't even do all the right things by closing off our borders to south asia early enough btw, and neither did UK which is what led to their delay in the 1st place.

 Agree on the how cautious part. I'm not advocating that we go back into full CB lockdown again either by the way but our govt is doing exactly what the UK govt is doing, delaying loosening but not tightening. Sure we're at different levels of restrictions but there's clearly different levels of risk appetite too. 

&gt;Is your point that even the UK medical body would disagree w that? 

No that isn't my point and I wouldn't presume to know what their medical body is thinking. On top of what I mentioned earlier, that given the circumstances of what UK has done and is still going through, it is prudent to reevaluate the allowing of dining in again. My view would be that if the numbers don't drop significantly to the single digits within the next few days, then the dining in should be delayed by another week, because 2 weeks is roughly the time it took for the anchorvale coffeshop cluster to come under control. Hope that clarifies."

I’m not saying we must cater to a minority. I’m saying before people sprout off things like “look, everyone at risk is vaccinated liao”, it would be nice to remember that this minority exist.

And I’m not asking you to remember anything extra for this group, just that we could have vaccinated them faster so that they aren’t put in excessive risk, such as dickhead employers who will soon insist that they show up in office instead of WFH as soon as the government say it isn’t mandatory, while cases rise because everyone assumes everyone who is at risk is vaccinated.

It cost us nothing more than a little empathy to understand that these groups could have been protected earlier and have their risk much reduced in this opening up that everyone wants.

**The fact is if the government themselves don’t even think they exist as a group to protect, all the more there should be awareness among the people of such vulnerable groups.** This is what I have been trying to speak out on: Awareness. 

I hope people have the empathy to give at least one fuck about such groups. We gave a lot of fucks about other groups in society, can’t we give this some fucks too?

Everyone can downvote me all they want and show how little empathy the majority always show to a minority, especially one that gets in their way. Go on and show how little fucks people give to them, especially when they are against your interests. I hope people remember to draw that parallel when other incidences occur where a smaller group’s interest is thrown under the bus. I hope people remember and know how easy it is for us to want to throw others under the bus.

It costs everyone nothing to care and remember that others exist. Sadly, even when something is free, people would refuse to do it and view it as a threat. All that talk about increasing the level of empathy in society is moot if people behave like this."

Can you imagine if it was the first time  the world encountered the [common flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm)?

&gt;	A 2018 CDC study published in Clinical Infectious Diseasesexternal icon looked at the percentage of the U.S. population who were sickened by flu using two different methods and compared the findings. Both methods had similar findings, which suggested that **on average, about 8% of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3% and 11%, depending on the season.**

I think the MMTF will get triggered and we will never ease our restrictions.

Edit:

For a [local context](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/869/doctor-i-have-flu):

&gt;	In Singapore, influenza-associated hospitalisation has been estimated to be 29.6 per 100000 persons each year, or about 1500 hospitalisations per year. The elderly and children had much higher rates of hospitalisation. Hospitalisation rates for persons &gt;75 years of age and children &lt;6 months of age were 47 times and 26 times higher, respectively, than those for persons 25–44 years of age. ​​An earlier study had estimated that influenza caused 588 deaths in Singapore annually.

3893,h21ffmo,Well the death rate over there is also in another different level...more death after reopening won't have same effect compared to if its happen in singapore. Some people still want to have less death y'know
3894,h21gus3,"That's fair that your risk threshold is: we cannot risk even one life, however small the chance of this person contracting and then dying/getting permanently disabled might be. And to you, the ""price to pay"" is low. 

The risk thresholds are just different for everybody, and it's up to the govt to make a policy decision that is sensible, logical, and not made on emotional grounds.

Certainly, as some have mentioned, the govt's risk thresholds are clearly about trade-offs for many other issues.

E.g. There are numerous studies who show that reducing driving speeds saves lives. The govt would save more than one patient/year easily if it simply mandated, let's say, highway speed limits to be reduced by 10km/h, or even 20km/h. And the ""price to pay"" can be argued to some as low? I mean, you want to get to work on time? Just wake up earlier! I say this not to be facetious, but to try to show how the ""we must save every life we can"" logic can be extended quite far.

Smoking/drinking - it is clear that banning those two will easily save a lot of lives (lung cancer, liver cancer, drink driving-related deaths) etc. In fact, I'm sure a sizable number of people would support the banning of these two so-called vices. But what are the costs of banning? Loss of personal freedom/choice (the ability of adults to make their own rational judgments on whether to partake in these activities?) Is that a low price to pay? Your mileage may vary.

You might say the price is low to wait till everyone is fully vaccinated. But to wait for what? For social distancing policies to be fully relaxed, masks to be off, borders to be fully re-opened? For sure, I think most people would agree with you if those are your considerations. 

But if we're talking about reinstating dining-in indoors with the usual Phase 2 capacity limits at the very least, then I certainly would argue it doesn't make sense to wait till we reach 100% vaccinations. The *risk* is far too low to justify that imposition, the costs. Mental health, loss of livelihoods, the hit to the economy, just the general loss of personal freedom - these are valid concerns that need to be weighed against the *risk* of, as you said, even one person getting Covid and eventually dying, because we re-opened dining-in. I think given where we already are with vaccinations, with numbers increasing by the day, and with vulnerable populations largely vaccinated, we are fine to do this at the very least. 

Because if you think about it, the govt *already* is accepting a level of risk by allowing social visits to homes. I just don't think opening dining-in moves the needle much in terms of the risk level. 

And again I think the Redditors/Singaporeans are generally sensible people - A year ago, with nobody vaccinated, I think most of us would agree err on the side of caution and be strict with lockdowns. The risk calculations are just different today."

3920,h21ztal,"&gt; Seems to be working.

How? We have been locked down for a month with no end in sight so it’s not working in preventing infections. It seems most spread in the home when we aren’t wearing masks anyway."
3921,h2244p8,"The disease is endemic. That's a fact ever since we discovered that it can spread asymptomatically and stay hidden within communities. We can't control the nature of spread, only mitigate the symptoms and minimize hospitalization and death. The new variant is more infectious, but everything we know about it points to it being no more severe or deadly, and importantly, that mRNA vaccines are still highly effective at stopping infection. Looking at the UK, we see an increase in case counts due to the Delta variant, but hospitalizations have continued to drop and deaths have remained in the single digits for many weeks. It's certainly a concern for poorly vaccinated countries like Malaysia or Taiwan, who have seen big spikes in deaths in recent weeks. However, the threat it poses to Singapore is greatly reduced by our widespread vaccination, and it is only diminishing more every day."
3922,h225xug,"I think what we’re discussing here, and people may not realise it, is the threshold to abandon containment strategy.

People are saying numbers don’t matter anymore because even if large numbers of people get infected, most will not get severe disease anymore as they are either vaccinated or young.

Basically, let it spread freely without attempting to ringfence or contact trace anymore (I.e. the original definition of DORSCON Red).

Because that’s exactly what they are saying when we believe there to be background undetected community transmission but we decide to abandon lockdown. Lockdown is intended as a transient measure to break the chain of community transmission before numbers exceed containment capacity. The nature of exponential spread is that if 1 patient infects 5 others on average, 5 patients will infect 25, 25 will infect 125. Even a marginally higher threshold leads to significantly higher risk of community spread, which will easily exhaust and exceed contact tracing capability and eventually QO facilities. Look at the number of clusters that have developed since the B1617 variant was discovered here. It seems like every day there is a new cluster, I can’t even keep track of them.

Once you abandon containment and it is out of hand, you can’t then decide to recontain it. Look at US/ Italy/India or even UK, countries that from the beginning decided not to even bother with containment. You can’t take it back. So I think people need to realise the gravity of the decision that we are making, venturing into the unknown that we don’t know how bad things are gonna be with our current incomplete vaccination status.

And I think it’s worth not abandoning containment strategy and allowing this to spread freely until we can give everyone a full dose vaccination to protect them against severe disease."
3923,h2277lf,"In well vaccinated countries around the world, case counts have become disjointed from hospitalizations and deaths. The US, for example, suffered a series of snowstorms in Feb which caused people to huddle in shelters, leading to a spike in cases. However, there was no corresponding spike in hospitalizations and deaths. In Europe, there was a similar spike in cases in April, being almost as high as the winter spike in places like Germany. However, unlike last year, they only observed a small bump in hospitalizations and no significant increase in deaths. Even if you take the Delta variant into consideration, things are still looking good. While cases in the UK have risen recently due to the new variant, hospitalizations continue to drop while daily deaths have remained in the single digits for many weeks.

The main reason for this is because covid is known to disproportionately kill elderly demographics. The US CDC reports as high as 8% mortality in those 75-84 and 28% in those 85+. However, the severity of the disease is comparable to influenza among the younger demographics, even without vaccination. That same study reports well under 0.1% mortality for those under 45, and the vast majority were either asymptomatic or showed only minor symptoms. This is exactly why we prioritized vaccinating the elderly many months ago, and we have given most of our silver generation maximum protection from the disease. When we remove the most vulnerable age group from the pool of infectable people, it's only natural that mortality drops like a rock, and the load on our hospitals is greatly reduced.

Furthermore, the assumption of exponential growth isn't valid in well vaccinated populations either. In those same snowstorms in the US, everyone was worried that when people left the shelter to return to normal life, a new wave of infections will break out. These storms primarily affected Texas too, a heavily republican state not known for following social distancing or mask wearing guidelines. However, cases very quickly dipped back down nationwide, and have dropped by over 95% since their winter spike. 

The recent disability home cluster provides more evidence of how effective vaccination is at controlling the disease. Of the 255 residents and staff, 92% had been vaccinated. CNA reported 34 cases, of which 4 were symptomatic. If we assume the worst case scenario that everyone was exposed to the virus, we calculate that around 86.7% of the people exposed were protected from infection. We can estimate the vaccine efficacy by dividing the overall protection rate by the inoculation rate, giving us roughly 94% efficacy, on par with the numbers reported by Pfizer or Moderna. Instead of a cluster snowballing out of control into the wider community, widespread vaccination prevented cases from spreading while preventing serious disease and death within the infected. The disability home outbreak should be seen as a prime example of how the Singapore will operate during our road to recovery, and highlights the importance and effectiveness of our vaccination programme."
3924,h227k6x,"By your own standards, a CB doesn’t work. We CB’d and covid’s still in the community.

CB is a dumbass no brain method of resolving the issue. It’s the equivalent of banning smoking and alcohol sales to 100% stop lung cancer and drink driving deaths. The US had something called Probibition and see how well that worked out.

That’s why we have vaccinations. But I guess for someone like you who can’t think beyond “lockdown or no lockdown” that’s too much to ask."
3926,h229hg5,"The issue with the delta variant for Singapore is its transmissibility = more cases. The UK doesn’t care about transmissibility if hospitalisation and death remain stable, which is the logical way to look at it. 

Yep, some restrictions on British tourists. Pretty much all my friends who live there are either on holiday or going in the next couple of months though."
3927,h22afhm,"We aren't locked down?  The only thing that is not happening is dining in?

3928,h22afno,"There should be an update regarding dining-in today. My guess is it'll still be on, but capped at 2. And probably family members dining out will be exempt from this restriction."
3929,h22ayzr,"Here’s what I don’t get - I read the MOH report almost every day and most common thing I see is that people get symptoms and ignore them for 2 or 3 days, creating these super-spreader events.

This is from the 16th: 
“Case 64260 is a 63 year-old male Singaporean who is a freelance worker and visits 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View frequently. He developed a cough, sore throat and runny nose on 12 June and sought medical treatment at a GP clinic on the same day where he was referred to undergo a COVID-19 test but did not do so. As he had been identified as a family member and household contact of Case 64229[9], he was placed on quarantine on 14 June. He was tested for COVID-19 on 15 June during quarantine, and his test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 16 June. His serology test result is negative for the N antigen, which suggests the presence of early infection. Case 64260 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 24 January, and the second dose on 16 February.”

So this guy walked around sick and infectious for at least 2 more days, and there are no consequences.

We are all stuck at home while these people act selfishly and keep this lockdown going on and on and on."
3930,h22bwzk,"&gt; We aren't locked down?

No, we're on Phase 3, Heightened Alert Dorscon Orange, which is nothing like a lockdown whatsoever so let's not use that language. 

&gt; You are making quite a bold claim that masking doesn't work given the comparative data with other nations.

I'm just saying we're all supposedly wearing our masks all the time, yet we're still seeing cases. I walked to the shops today, and in the car park there were at least 20 different people with masks off, some smoking, most chatting, none paying any attention to the rules. On the grass nearby were a bunch of people training without a mask on, or at least pretending to train without one on. At the shop there were several with it round their chin or under their noses..... etc etc

People are fucking bored of these stupid rules and no consistency now, and who can blame them?"

We seem to have both lived through 2020.  Your memory is awfully short if you don't remember all shops being closed except supermarkets, no offices open, no schools open.  The difference between now and last month is no dining in.  Whoop-dee-doo.

&gt; no consistency ... still seeing cases

I hate to break it to you, but anecdotes don't replace data.  You are directly contradicting yourself when you claim there's a lockdown and then say in the very next breath that you see people gathering (legally).

We are still seeing cases on a comparable level to a very hard lockdown in 2020, which means that whatever is happening now seems to be working.  While I'm all for opening up and letting the idiots take their chances, the fact remains that not everyone who wants a vaccine can get one yet.

The government's approach right now is akin to stamping on the brakes because they see a car in front, when in reality the cars around are accelerating slowly. We shouldn't be reckless and go straight to 5th gear, but also need to gradually lift off the brake pedal otherwise the car can never move forward with the traffic."

&gt; SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 multi-ministry task force is ""evaluating the timing and scope"" of the next stage of Singapore's reopening, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said in a Facebook post on Wednesday (Jun 16).

&gt; 

&gt; ""We are now at stage 1 of our reopening. Stage 2 is scheduled next Monday. Unfortunately we now have new cases breaking out and a major new cluster in Bukit Merah,"" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; ""Given these developments, we are evaluating the timing and scope of the next stage of reopening. The MTF is studying the situation carefully with public health experts and will provide further updates soon.""

&gt; 

&gt; As of Tuesday, the Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre COVID-19 cluster consisted of 25 cases.

&gt; 

&gt; In a video accompanying his Facebook post, Mr Wong said that the new COVID-19 cases in Bukit Merah are ""breaking out not only in the market and the hawker centre, but also, all around the vicinity"".

&gt; ""And day by day, we are seeing the number of unlinked cases, the cryptic cases in the community are likely to be rising too,"" he said.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The market, which was slated to reopen on Wednesday after being closed since Sunday, will now be shut for two weeks until Jun 26.

&gt; 

&gt; Explaining the decision on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that the detection of more cases among employees at the market and their close contacts suggests there is ""ongoing spread with wider transmission"".

&gt; 

&gt; All staff and tenants who had been working at the market from May 25 were placed on quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; All 85 tenants and workers of the neighbouring 116 Bukit Merah View have also been tested for COVID-19, while free COVID-19 testing has been extended to members of the public who had visited the shops at 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View between May 25 and Jun 12.

&gt; Stallholders at Redhill Market and Food Centre, which is a short walk away from Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre, will undergo mandatory swab tests after a COVID-19 case recently visited the market.

&gt; ""I know this is a difficult time for everyone,"" Mr Wong said.

&gt; ""I want to assure all of you that we are doing our very best to control the infection and we want to ensure that we do not have another flare-up before we reach sufficiently high levels of vaccination in our community.""

&gt; Dining-in at food and beverage outlets is currently banned as part of Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) and was scheduled to resume on Jun 21, provided the COVID-19 situation remained under control.

3953,h5dop3e,"&gt; # COVID-19: Dining-in group size back to 2; groups of 5 only if all fully vaccinated

&gt; SINGAPORE: Dining-in at F&amp;B establishments will be reduced to groups of two for people who are not fully vaccinated, the co-chair of the multi-ministerial task force Gan Kim Yong announced.

&gt; Those who are fully vaccinated can continue to dine-in in groups of five, he added, speaking at a press conference on Friday (Jul 16).

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; This and other tightened measures for higher-risk indoor, mask-off settings will be in effect from Jul 19 to Aug 8.

&gt; 

&gt; “This targeted approach will better protect those who are yet to be vaccinated while allowing those who have been fully vaccinated to continue with the current measures,” said Mr Gan, who is also Minister for Trade and Industry.

&gt; 

&gt; A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after they have received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccines, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release.

&gt; Unvaccinated people with a valid negative pre-event COVID-19 test (PET) result or recovered individuals can also participate in such groups of five, said the Health Ministry.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Dining-in across the island in groups of five resumed on Monday (Jul 12), as the number of new COVID-19 community cases decreased in the week before.

&gt; These new measures come as a new cluster linked to KTV lounges emerged a day after dining-in in groups of five resumed. As of Friday, the cluster is linked to 120 cases, making it Singapore’s largest active COVID-19 cluster.

&gt; CHILDREN UNDER 12

&gt; Since children below the age of 12 are not eligible for any COVID-19 vaccine under Singapore’s national vaccination programme, these unvaccinated children can also dine with members of the same household without pre-event testing, the press release read.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; “This whole group should not exceed 5 persons. If the children are not from the same household, then they should constitute not more than half the dine-in group,” said the Health Ministry.

&gt; F&amp;B dine-in cap of children aged 12 years and below, across different scenarios. (Image: Ministry of Health)

&gt; F&amp;B establishments “have the flexibility to decide” whether to introduce the vaccination-differentiated group sizes, depending on their own operating model, customers and whether they can check on the status of individuals dining in, said MOH in the press release.

&gt; At hawker centres, food courts and coffee shops, group sizes will remain at two people, said the Health Ministry.

&gt; These are “more porous” settings and generally do not impose compulsory SafeEntry check-ins, and it would be challenging to check whether the individuals have been vaccinated or have tested negative for COVID-19 before they seat themselves, said MOH.

&gt; Live performances, recorded music and videos will continue to be prohibited at F&amp;B establishments.

&gt; 

&gt; WEDDING RECEPTIONS

&gt; As for wedding receptions, they can continue with groups of five per table, without the requirement for all individuals in the group to be fully vaccinated, said MOH.

&gt; There is also no change to the pre-event testing requirement - the reception can comprise up to 250 people with pre-event testing in place, and 50 people with pre-event testing only for the wedding party.

&gt; “We acknowledge that wedding couples have faced significant uncertainties over the past few months. Hence, we will allow this key life event to continue at current numbers and PET provisions, so that couples do not need to revise their wedding plans again,” said the Health Ministry.

&gt; 

&gt; POTENTIAL OF ""VERY LARGE CLUSTERS"" MERGING

&gt; “Why are we doing this? Because there is a real risk that the cases from these clusters would have spread to the community, especially if there are individuals who have not come forward for testing,” said co-chair of the multi-ministerial task force Lawrence Wong.

&gt; “And we suspect there are such individuals, and they would have spread the virus to the people around them. Potentially this means that we can see very large clusters emerging over the coming weeks.”

&gt; To deal with a similar emergence of a large cluster in the past, the Government would have opted for “very stringent” tightened measures, almost like a “circuit breaker”, said Mr Wong.

&gt; “But the difference today is that we have a much higher vaccination rate, and therefore we do not at this moment think there is a need for such significant tightening.

&gt; “Instead, we will take a more targeted approach, adjust our measures based on vaccination status, and also with an eye to the hospitalisation and ICU capacity in our system.”

4020,h5i69ux,"Imma repeat this once more:

Endemic is when a population achieves herd immunity where it is defined as x% immune through vaccination or past infection. This percentage is calculated based on the properties and behaviour of each virus. For SARS-Cov-2, it has been calculated to be when 70-80% is immune and immunity starts from 2 weeks after the final dose (or in the case of those with past infection, after their one dose).

Right now we are at 70+% with at least one DOSE and 40+% who took two shots with not everyone being two weeks past their second shots. This is not yet endemic. There are plenty of people who CANNOT take their shots because of their age (below 12) or other legit medical reasons. We are all depending on the eligible population to behave responsibly and it is clear that many people cannot be trusted."
4021,h5m7b3c,"The thing is no one really seems to care about details anymore

you read 88 cases detected today, most of the population assumes they caught the virus today, not that they were infected weeks ago when reported case numbers were low and everyone was saying SG is so safe

decisions are made in a panic, we lockdown again just like we did for Bukit Merah and TTSH, reopen, cases spike a few weeks later, cycle repeats itself

we aren’t very different from AU and NZ in that regard"
4022,h5mbc68,"That's why the government needs to lead the way. If the government were to trust the science and act with confidence, the population will be given a sense of strength and stability. If their decisions were justified with data and projections, we will have a much better understanding of the overall situation.

Instead, they decided to implement snap restrictions and contradicted their earlier message about de-emphazising case counts and focusing on case severity. The number of ICU and severe hospitalizations have stayed low, and we know that the rate of people dying of this disease is much much lower than before. This cycle of opening and closing will destroy any confidence in our economy and, if extended, will ruin our local businesses."

If the restrictions do scale back, it's most likely the quantity of permissible pax, but vax status screening is definitely going to stay if we want to be on track towards reopening. 

The restriction lasting up until Aug 8 is also most likely going to motivate a lot of people who've yet to move forward their 2nd dose to do it, even though you need the 2-week clearance. We all bow to the Nat Day KPI at the end of the day."

4075,h5dp24u,"&gt; # S'pore cuts dining-in cap to 2 as Covid-19 KTV cluster grows; up to 5 at some F&amp;B outlets if fully vaccinated

&gt; SINGAPORE - Unvaccinated people here will only be allowed to dine alone or in pairs from Monday (July 19), but fully vaccinated people will be able to continue to dine in in groups of five.

&gt; But unvaccinated individuals with a valid negative pre-event test (PET) result may join in such groups of five, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (July 16).

&gt; People who have recovered from Covid-19 are also deemed to be at lower risk and can dine in groups of up to five as well, said the ministry.

&gt; The roll-back of dining-in measures here, currently at five people for all, comes after the emergence of new Covid-19 clusters that have been a setback to the efforts of Singapore, said MOH.

&gt; The ministry said in a statement that fully-vaccinated individuals will be able to continue to dine-in in groups of up to five persons at food and beverage establishments that have put in place systems to check the status of such individuals.

&gt; This is because fully-vaccinated individuals have good protection against infection and severe illness, and are also less likely to infect others as compared to unvaccinated individuals, it added.

&gt; An individual is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after he or she has received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccine, said MOH.

&gt; Members of the same household will be allowed to dine with their unvaccinated children aged 12 or below, without the need for PET for these children, but MOH said that this whole group should not exceed five people.

&gt; ""If the children are not from the same household, then they should constitute not more than half the dine-in group,"" said MOH.

&gt; The ministry added that children below 12 are currently ineligible for Covid-19 jabs in Singapore's national vaccination programme, and it is also more challenging to swab these young children for PET.

&gt; Food and beverage establishments have the flexibility to decide whether to introduce the vaccination-differentiated group sizes, depending on their own operating model and clientele, and their ability to check the status of dining-in individuals, said the ministry.

&gt; But group sizes will be limited to two people for hawker centres, foodcourts, and coffee shops.

&gt; This is because these venues have a ""more porous setting"" and generally do not impose mandatory SafeEntry check-ins, said MOH. It noted that it would be very challenging to check the status of individuals before they seat themselves at a table.

&gt; Entertainment such as live performances, recorded music and video or television screenings will continue to be prohibited at food and beverage establishments.

&gt; MOH said that this is because dining-in remains a high-risk activity because many people will be unmasked and in close proximity with each other.

&gt; ""Patrons at food and beverage establishments are also reminded to adhere to all safe management measures and keep their masks on at all times except when eating or drinking,"" said MOH.

Eg someone who interacted with an infected hostess has a household family member who tests positive.

4319,h5e34q2,Also pity those looking forward to celebrating their Hari Raya Haji on Tuesday.
4320,h5e35ac,PAP full of lies
4321,h5e3f5j,"cool. I just read some of your other comments, but I don’t understand why you’re so anti-Pap. Whilst I am pro-opp, and I am sick of the back and forth going on. 

I don’t think they are liars. I just think they are clueless in their moves to counter Covid, or they don’t really have an exit plan."
4322,h5e3khu,Last few moh reports said a few 1st dose still got hospitalised. No 2nd dose (full vac) got hospitalised.
4323,h5e3kkg,"Yup, throw the whole book at them if they don't own up and get caught. No reason they can't be traced."
4324,h5e3qg0,"&gt;endemic 

Haven't endemic still majority are fully vaccinated lah."
4325,h5e3xmg,"I can’t know what ministers are thinking but it seems pretty obvious the plan is to keep as many people alive as possible, even the idiots, until a significant portion of the population is fully vaccinated.

The reason why they don’t say “we will open in September/October” or “target 75%” is because said idiots will intentionally not get vaccinated hoping someone else will get us all over the finish line.

It seems like the G was right in that there are a lot of idiots in our population that basically are unable to see beyond their own little bubble. Singapore is already very small but they somehow, like you, manage to be even **more** myopic."
4326,h5e3zxx,"Exactly why I’m voting them out.

They don’t offer any better solutions that inspire exceptional confidence in their leadership. 

You can argue with me whether they lied or not. OYK clearly said one thing the other day, and turned tail today. That is a fact.

They’ve only shown to not be worse than countries with leaders you don’t have high expectations of. 

But they are not thought leaders like LKY, they are simply administrators. The fact you can compare their policymaking to decision making in the army says enough."
4327,h5e433f,"It's too far for people to care, they only care about their own backyard."
4328,h5e4a5i,They can’t be traced because they didn’t TraceTogether. It’s call underground and discreet for a reason.
4329,h5e4avp,"So you call me a moron, but have no idea what they are thinking yourself

No answer when i asked you a direct qn with real world implications

The plan is to keep people alive? How many have died from suicide since the pandemic vs covid? Have they done well based on that metric?

You Sure talk a lot and say nothing at all"
4330,h5e4eki,Whoever these ppl who visited these KTV outlets better pray I don't meet them in public.
4331,h5e4ki6,more like KTVs flip the prata for us
4332,h5e4tgb,"And indeed those will suffer the most!

It's a death sentence for hawkers. Now families will o in neighboring low priced restaurants if they go out..."
4333,h5e53ub,"I doubt the govt wouldn’t lockdown if we have a 80% full vax rate but 100 asymptomatic cases a day

It’s hardwired into them at this point

Happy to be proven wrong but honestly, what do people think is more likely based on their covid policy track record?"
4334,h5e574p,Choose the comparison with the same vaccination rate please
4335,h5e5fi7,"I tell you what, since you say “never” and I say “inevitable”, shall we make a $100 wager to the charity of the winner’s choice that we will be more or less fully open by the end of the year?  Things like welcoming back EP holders, travel with certain destinations etc.

That’s less than 6 months from now, so should fit into your never time frame pretty well right?"
4336,h5e5gdy,Funny part is I actually think the Family KTV joints wouldn't have spread the disease this much
4337,h5e5jum,"Still deflecting and not answering the qn

Done with you"
4338,h5e5t4d,"RemindMe! 6 months

I’m not deflecting - I’m saying based on past track record, money #1.  You are looking at small money. The G is looking at big money.  The restaurant sector is not more important than all other sectors.

Put your money where your mouth is."
4339,h5e5u07,You guys deserve a pay raise!
4340,h5e5xyf,"So why are we at rule of 5 now? Why didn’t we go pass 8 when there were no cases?

That was the question. Where is your answer?"
4341,h5e5y09,"their track record is not based on 80% full vax rate.

The entire point of all of this (quarantine, vaccinations) is to prevent deaths. Post majority vaccination, if people are only mildly ill and asymptomatic then it's endemic and there's no need for lockdowns anymore

also with such a high herd immunity I doubt that the spread can even reach 100 easily, which is another benefit of the vaccine"

Ridiculous nursing manager with decade old management style combined with unchecked authority. It just not worth it."
4345,h5e69l9,"That’s the argument I’d like to believe

But the reality is that the govt has played safe for almost 2 years

During phase 3, we even had the balls to reject faster vaccination. Did we increase gatherings from groups of 8?

Look at the recent suicide stat published. Did anyone even blink?  But here we are, still hyperfocused on covid"
4346,h5e6bkm,"How did they pay for their fun? Did they have a phone on them?

Plenty of ways to find them if they wanted to."
4347,h5e71ey,"I can think of lots of reasons - 5 people spreading to 4 families controls cluster size.  8 might have been too much, and 2 might have been too restrictive.

You might as well ask why the speed limit is 60?  The number is picked due to past data, compliance and future predictions.

If they really didn’t care about money (because they have to pay out tax dollars to support business) then it’s be back to 0.  Hard CB, takeaway only."

4375,h5eq9si,"That's incorrect though. Might be a myth that people like to throw around.

Outside of China, the most surveilled cities are London, Indore, and Hyderabad. That's measuring on cameras per person.

If measuring purely on cameras, Singapore is still behind London, Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai and Moscow (again excluding China)."
4376,h5er0s7,Endemic is only when most of us are fully vaccinated. This means very low chance of needing hospitalisation.

4381,h5esvvk,bless mine's on 19th July too but now I got excuse not to eat out with family and can celebrate in peace lol. just buy one cake sua
4382,h5et01d,"the solution to this would be to show what their exit plan is. based on what vaccination rate and what case numbers, what their plan for reopening is, and when they need to tighten. [like this](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/info/restart)

of course, if the MTF doesn't actually have a plan, all they can do is say ""we have a plan"" and hope people believe them."
4383,h5etyli,"OYK didn't ask people to go KTV tho, those assholes screwed a pretty good record we've been having for weeks."
4384,h5euofb,"Have to consider that cancelling NDP has ramifications on national morale, even if you and I personally may not care about it. It sends a message that things are getting bad, we don’t have the situation under control, we’re fighting a losing battle, the country is giving up etc."

4386,h5ewb27,"we stick to the rules and have to suffer reversal of dine in rules, while those unkers and hostesses quarantined probably get a 2 week stay in a nice hotel if not hospitalised?

also, it's so dumb that KTV cluster was not caused by singing karaoke -_-

4400,h5fdwtd,"She has since fully recovered, thanks for asking! There’s a long waiting list for sinovac, so it’ll be a little while more till she can get vaccinated with that. 

In the meantime, I just think that it is a little unfair to penalize the folks who cannot be fully/partially vaccinated due to health reasons with stricter covid-related restrictions. I’m just hoping that once the vaccination rates reach the point where herd immunity can be achieved within Singapore, the gov won’t continue to segregate restrictions for the vaxed VS. non-vaxed people."
4401,h5fhsn2,"Not only owners. I walk around outside I see many patrons sit in twos on one table drinking and  mingling with the next table. They are so inconsiderate, that place they are in might close down because of them. 😞"

To those KTV patrons, who think with their down there, well, I hope you lose that down there. Get severed, Idgaf. Because of idiots like you, we are in this deep shit. It was going well, but you just can't keep your dicks in your pants. 

You didn't just fuck a Viet bu. You fucked us up too. Fucking idiots. 

And to the G that said there won't be any reversal to current rule, yeahhhhhhh what a load of horseshit that was."

4404,h5fozhd,"Fwiw ah, you wanna go to these seedy places and remove your masks, fine. But at least make sure you get vaccinated fully before you go?"
4405,h5fpt45,That was the least serious virus those patrons caught.
4407,h5fzsjq,"Bit of a late reply, but I don’t think we’d even be more or less opened up by EOTY. Look at us from 2020 till now. It’s just back and forth, like a rocking chair. 

May be far fetched, but I believe SG will only fully open up in 2023."

4412,h5gpjk7,"20 May, haven't gone out to celebrate for for over a year."
4413,h5gq87l,"Another way to see it, if NDP creates a major cluster, it will likely be bigger than the KTV cluster. If it happens and they tighten measures , it will be worse for morale

Questions will be raised, are we ready to open, is our vaccine really working, what is our plan. It's not just people living here, but also investors, event organisers, etc"
4414,h5gye5s,"Well I think there are different factors to consider:

* Cluster is less likely to happen, being outdoors and stuff

* Everyone will be vaccinated, so severity will be much less than the KTV cluster

* Generally more of the public vaccinated (target 2/3) so overall public health risk is lower

* Tbh if a cluster happens, the silver lining is that it’s a good opportunity to show people that we can live with the numbers rather than be so sensitive to them - we need to take the plunge at some point if we wish to move on"

Edit/Add-on: Again, this is a selfish and personal take, but I'm sick of how our age group is losing our youth and ""hustling time"" to COVID because of some dumb YPs, anti-vax boomers, ham sup los, etc etc etc worsening the COVID situation. (I know the reality is not as simple as that, but that's certainly how shit feels. Makes me want to be immature and throw a tantrum a little!) And not to mention all the harm caused to businesses and employees...

The govt keeps saying they will provide the relevant financial aid, but they always make the process exceedingly convoluted, as if it were trying to deny your application at every step of the way. Even when I helped my parents apply for stuff like the CRG, all we got was ministry A saying ministry B didn't have the documents we sent them, and hence the application will be rejected and we'll have to start all over. Grrr I just wanna be so paggro rn! Like maybe my whole family is illiterate and can't fill up simple forms ah. Maybe we're just stupid; maybe we can't follow simple instructions; maybe that's why we're earning &lt;2k per month and getting fricked by COVID ah.

Other people just taopao then go outside at the picnic field or whatever open roof area in a shopping mall and eat together. Last time during Heightened Alert, it was a very common sight. Suddenly all the dining areas shift to open picnic areas.

Lmao gg no re. 

Seriously though, what a shit government. Utter cowards."
4481,h5umx6h,Sian but not surprised. The brief respite was fun while it lasted.
4482,h5umxan,"Seems like even with the highest vaccination rates in the world, we're going back into another month of lockdown as everyone else reopens. Why? To save a few old people who have had half a year to get vaccinated but they don't want to. &gt;95% of infections are mild or asymptomatic and literally 100% of those fully vaccinated have mild symptoms"
4483,h5umxb5,They’re linked. Patient 0 of the fishery cluster went to ktv…

4485,h5umxbe,Dunno how many weeks and we’ll be through
4487,h5umxs8,"Didn't they say that we will never need to close restaurants because of our vaccination rates? Didn't they say that they will monitor if our ICU rates increased from 1 to 100, then they will see whether they need to change current measures?

Why flipping prata? Can they please be more transparent to address these comments made earlier?

Edit: Close restaurants instead of going back to P2HA."

4490,h5umyg9,"Yeah inevitable seeing the trends. Have to cut the transmission. Meanwhile, keep speeding up vaccination."
4491,h5umyts,"Yes, but just statistically, the fishery/market one is exploding. KTV cluster is already tapering off."
4492,h5umyx4,"However, when we outlined our plans to live with Covid-19, we also emphasised that we needed to significantly raise our vaccination, and meanwhile we still need to keep infection under control to protect the unvaccinated, especially the elderly. Over the next few weeks, we will make a much bigger push to get our elderly population vaccinated,"" he said.


The authorities also had to consider the level of community exposure, with the latest wave at wet markets and food centres affecting a wider spectrum of people, as well as some 200,000 people above the age of 60 who remain unvaccinated and therefore have a high likelihood of falling critically ill once infected, he said.

4533,h5un9ak,I'm tired Robbie.
4534,h5un9gt,So disappointed. This happened because people can’t keep it in their pants.
4535,h5un9th,Dude even if you're unvaccinated the chance of falling ill to the point you need to be hospitalised is like 5% not exactly a hard dice to roll
4536,h5un9y3,"This is honestly fucking ridiculous. We cannot piss ourselves everytime there is a spike like this over the next decade. At this point, I’m legitimately considering going overseas for work. It’s not worth wasting my youth here when we can’t do anything with our time and our timid gov."
4537,h5un9yl,They say schools not closing but anyone know about CCAs?
4538,h5una2u,"stats wise yea, but thats just cause obviously the fishery is more public? not everyone is horny to go ktv but id say the fishery is more 'essential' and hence its 'exploding' more.

4542,h5unc1q,Hey thanks for your thoughtfulness. I will refrain from advertising my store here. But the outlook is honestly bleak - during P2HA our revenues fell by around 70% even after exploring all options.
4543,h5unch4,"Hmm another post got deleted.. 

I am surprised with this. And I wonder how bad the extent of the transmission is now, and what they are expecting in the immediate week for them to do this.

Just stay safe, everyone."
4544,h5uncm9,Don't forget they supply F&amp;B directly...
4546,h5uncsm,"yeah, so discouraging :( but i get that it’s kinda necessary with so many cases + we’re so close to being 2/3 vaxxed"
4547,h5unct5,They better jail and fine those responsible for this mess or else more people will feel like you. I think it’s time for the gov to reconsider allowing these KTV establishments to exist or ring them in stronger from here on.

4557,h5une0y,As someone who owned a family KTV I feel your pain. Government has categorically ruled out shielding us from the landlords. We are in this fight ourselves.
4558,h5une6v,That 30% on first dose not work well enough for this variant. Damn jibai. Delta variant must take 2 doses to be useful. Plus that R0 rate of infection actually requires 90+% full vaccination to break chain of spread. Sian daooooo

And how will banning gyms and restaurants dine-in help when most of the clusters are in the fishery port, wet markets, and hawker centres? People are still going to continue with their grocery shopping and takeaway from hawker centres.

Why can't we just trust that the testing, tracing, and vaccination will work out? It's as if the govt don't even trust the strategy they put up themselves to head to the ""new normal""."

I've seen lots of people on this subreddit comment how we are going back to normal once everyone is vaccinated. If we have nearly 50% fully vaccinated already and cannot even do something as basic as dining in a restaurant, how do you expect drastic changes to happen by the time we are 70-80% fully vaccinated? (which btw, we are only a few weeks away from achieving)           
We will not be going back to normal anytime soon unless people demand we go back to normal. We need to stop looking at case numbers and just focus on the ICU numbers.               
Anyway, I'm going to be out of work for the 2nd time this year, but hey at least we can soon parade on single-digit case numbers like the childish idiots we have become whilst unemployment and mental health issues skyrocket!"

4620,h5unqrb,What the fuck is my exit plan
4621,h5unqtq,"The end of it is that our ""high vaccination rate"" just means that we're doing better than other countries, doesn't mean that it's high enough yet to effectively cut transmission to sufficiently low rates. One dose is clearly insufficient at only a ~30% effectiveness rate. Even if we have 50% jabbed, remember that it still needs 2 weeks after the second jab to be fully effective. The end goal is clearly in sight - 2 weeks after 80+% vaccination rate has been reached. Until then, it makes sense to move to cut transmission rate given the current undetected spread."

Sure... agree... but timing is everything. ""Opening to the world"" pre-maturely when the world was still screwed with COVID will always be a dumb policy. 

See now how lor. We were better off after the circuit breaker last year with mostly just the domestic economy functioning. Now with all these sporadic pseudo lockdowns since the delta variant entered the country, all the small and medium sized businesses and hawkers are worse off.

Touch your heart and tell me that Phase 3 wasn't a pretty good situation compared to what we're having now for the majority of the population. You can't. Phase 3 was great. But nooooo ""we must remain open to the world."" This is what you get for it. Now you get to live with the consequence. This is what happens when you chase after money without using brains.

Old stubborn people aside, delta variant has been sending more kids to hospitals than the earlier variants and we still don’t have a vaccine for under 12s. If this spreads like wildfire in primary schools and kindergartens and kids start winding up in ICUs, everyone will blame the gahmen for not locking down. 


But easy for me to say. I’m just an armchair commenter who doesn’t have to make life and death policy decisions. You think ministers also want to tighten restrictions?

4668,h5unz0u,"Got downvoted to hell few days ago by suggesting that vaccinations will not be enough if gahmen and people are sensitive to hundreds of cases (millions of people will remain unvaccinated even with 75% population fully vaccinated). Unless something changes (forcing vaccines or accepting high case numbers), we are not getting out of this cycle."

4672,h5unzla,"So once again, before there is even the possibility of enough data to figure out if we were going to be able to vaccinate our way through the KTV event, ministry of overreaction decides to f#*@ everything up.  30 days later, it will be completely obvious that we were going to put out the KTV fire without tightening measures.  It will be obvious because tightening measures will drop cases like a rock after the current clusters burn out all around the same time.  We're like a kid in the rain with an umbrella running back inside after the first drop hits them instead of taking a few steps outside of cover to figure out if we even need the umbrella."
4673,h5unzz6,Seniors probably make up a large number of the unvaccinated boomer ktv cluster
4674,h5unzze,Does this mean the SG-HK bubble isn’t happening….again?
4675,h5uo0he,"Yeah I think the math is that if there’s a huge community outbreak, the unvaccinated going into ICU can still overwhelm us as we only have a capacity of 1000 beds. Unless the vaccinated percentage goes up to 70-80%."
4676,h5uo0jh,I am legitimately pissed right now. How many people are on oxygen/ICU?
4677,h5uo0o1,"Guess we throwing the endemic around like it doesnt mean somthing huh. Can we just force the elderly to get vaccinated. Enough of this bs man. Like if you think you gonna die from covid, pls take the vacckne"

4683,h5uo1mf,"Agreed , and biz owners already had a gut feeling as well."
4684,h5uo1mt,"Did you read the article?

The serious jump in cases from 60 per day to almost double means cannot leave open.  “We made plans to go Sentosa already, so what if it rains heavily?”

The hint is right there - racing to 2/3+ fully vaccinated (70%) “just a few weeks away”.  

Everyone else who is reluctant is going to be left behind."
4685,h5uo1on,"I don’t know if you’re being satirical or whatever but KTV is not a damn essential. Even if you don’t go to KTV, so what? You won’t get a heart attack and die on the spot from not going to KTV.
 
Hawker Center, obviously is an essential. We are people and people need to eat to live. Unless you can tell me that we run on gasoline, electricity or something.  
  
Even if a cluster stems from an eatery, it’s at least justified because people go there to eat. KTV on the other hand is just for fun."

4689,h5uo2zx,"yes that's exactly what they said and here we are two days later with still one person in ICU but it's back to P2(HA). The entire point of vaccination is that cases don't result in hospitalisation, and to this point they haven't and there's not even a rising trend of symptomatic sickness. If there was, I'd agree with these measures but as usual it's say one thing, do something entirely different.   


I really wonder how much longer they expect people to put up with this crap."

Here I am playing my part and being responsible for the past year, following every rule but we’re still back in this mess because a group of people weren’t careful while having fun. Not to mention the taxpayers money used to pay for their quarantine and the daily payout they get. 

I always encourage people to jiayou and bear with it but now I think I’ll feel bad telling them that. Our efforts always go down the drain. 😪"
4692,h5uo424,"I truly hope NDP turns into a superspreader event and showcases to the world this government has no fucking clue what they are doing. For those keeping track, they have changed major covid regulations 3 times in the past 2 weeks, and that's not even counting the smaller scale targeted measures that affects our fishmongers and other businesses. And yet, full steam ahead for NDP which involves multiple agencies ACROSS THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT BODY."

I forced myself to take care of my body more this period and have been forcing myself to excercise and this happens again... just when I had somewhat of a regular routine in my life... this just sucks man and my hearts goes out to all the hawkers out there... it is so sad to see some of my hawker spots close down in this period... this whole back and forth of going into phases and out of it is draining

""Five weeks is what it takes. We cannot wait five weeks. By the third week, if we see the number go up, action has to be taken, quickly and rewind this back to Phase Two (heightened alert),” 

3 days later, P2HA. If they told us if within this week we go to P2HA to protect ICU then I understand. But because of this quote makes me feel that he's not telling the public the truth on their plans."
4701,h5uo5ow,"lol Seriously what is this bullshit?

So the vaccine totally useless huh? I mean total number of cases(tested positive) was announced, but no mention of severity of illness among these cases.

If government so scare die need to go to the extent of disallowing dining in, does that mean all these recent cases hardly anyone is asymptotic(or at least mildly sick). Or just so heng all the market ppl belong to the unvaccinated group?

Shouldn't endermic be living along with the virus? Or their definition of living along is &lt;30 case daily among a population of millions?

Don't tell me end of the day, the goal is to have &lt;30 cases daily so government can show off their wonderful stats to other countries and start their travel bubble😡"

No one cares about boomers who choose not to take vaccine tbh they have to accept the consequences"
4710,h5uo743,"So the country with the highest vaccination rates in the world is going back into lockdown for a month, ruining the lives of 5m+ people to save the 300k or so selfish boomers who have had MONTHS to get vaccinated but didn't.

You do realize that we are not starting from 0 in terms of vaccination right? We have more than 70% who have received their first dose. About 50% have received their second and more to come. We are among the foremost in terms of vaccination drives. But among the countries with high vaccination rates, we have the most restrictions. 

In all, if you belong to the camp that loves lockdowns, happy for you."

This is just how it works, infection cycles of 3-6 months in length.  Cases go up, lockdown, cases go down, relax lockdown, then repeat.  It’s not just Singapore doing this.

For the countries that won’t see high percentage of vaccinations (Australia) will get through this wave, then probably see another 2 before they get everyone vaccinated."

4776,h5uokgh,"I posted a reply to u/phonemnk on OYK quote. They mentioned to revert to P2HA if the instances that ICU is unable to cope with cases.

I understand that they need to go to P2HA to protect the ICU. BUT, if they told us the media that they PLAN to go to P2HA within this week if cases doubled and tripled, then ok. We accept it. But they said otherwise, they told us they will review it everyday and 3 weeks later, if numbers goes up, they revert. Instead, 3 days later they go to P2HA.

Edit: Lastly, aren't we taking COVID as endemic? Didnt they say they will monitor hospitalisations and ICU cases instead of daily cases? Even despite increase in daily cases, if our hospitalisation and ICU is low, we still can cope with it. Are we going back on our word to try to get our country back to ZERO Covid again instead of being an endemic state? I understand vaccination is not maximized to herd immunity and seniors are at high risk. But if at 50% full vaccinations and seniors refuse to get vaccinated, we are continuously stuck in this vicious cycle of restrictions for years to come. But i understand till high vaccination rates, we can open up more confidently. IMO, im just afraid if more seniors refused to get vaccinated, because if the rate is not high, we will be stuck in this cycle."
4777,h5uokni,"Not the best comparison, but you get the idea. 

Yes, you can. But the official narrative is that you will most likely be asymptomatic or have a mild case.

So in the face of this situation (and bearing in mind our vaccination rates), its just like banning all vehicles because road accidents happen."
4778,h5uokvi,"Ok I can’t really locate the exact source for this quote, though fragments of it are in various European news reports. 

“Below is the summary of Macron's speech on 12/6/21 [edit: July] in France announcing measures for those who do not want to be vaccinated.  The next day there were a million appointments to get vaccinated.

""I no longer have any intention of sacrificing my life, my time, my freedom and the adolescence of my daughters [need source], as well as their right to study properly, for those who refuse to be vaccinated. This time you stay at home, not us.""

""It’s a matter of individual responsibility [...] but also a matter of our freedom""

In France, those who do not get vaccinated will no longer be able to go to restaurants, cafes (from early August), cinemas &amp; museums (from July 21) and get on airplanes or trains (from August).  Alternatively, you will have to submit a negative test, which will no longer be free (49 euros for the PCR, 29 for the antigen).  

Macron then announced the vaccination obligation for medical personnel &amp; for those who work in contact with fragile people.  Since September 15, a nurse who has refused to be vaccinated will no longer be able to go to work and receive a salary.  ""We cannot make those who have the civic sense to get vaccinated bear the burden of inconvenience,"" Macron said. ""The restrictions will weigh on others, those who for reasons incomprehensible in the country of Louis Pasteur, science and the Enlightenment still hesitate to use the only weapon available against the pandemic, the vaccine.""  ""I am aware of what I am asking you,"" he said, ""and I know that you are ready for this commitment. This is, in a sense, part of your sense of duty.""

“Get vaccinated!” was the president’s overall message. He even tweeted a GIF of himself repeating the phrase.  “The equation is simple. The more we vaccinate, the less space we leave this virus to circulate.”

Macron explained that the government was striving to achieve a 100% vaccination rate across the country.”

At this point, I can’t help but agree. Barring those who have contraindications, the rest of the population in Sg, by August, would’ve had ample time to get a vaccine. We can’t live in this limbo forever."

4782,h5uolis,"Friendly reminder that this P2HA has already occurred 1 month ago back in the JEM and Westgate cases. So i guess this is gonna continue till the end of time until:

1) We have mandatory vaccination requirements (Those seniors who are unvaccinated would definitely not be vaccinated anytime soon)

2) We choose to be endemic and understand the risks to be endemic (people who are unvaccinated would undertake the risks involved)

Our govt has no plan. I hate to say it, but whats gonna happen after this restriction? whats gonna happen after National Day? You cant just put restrictions with no end goal and expect people to continue following it till the end of time. People are just gonna get fatigued out."

4784,h5uoml6,"Exactly this. The government has been urging them to get vaccinated for 6 months and they're still refusing to without valid reasons.

However, given that he used 1 week as the doubling time (for ICU cases) when we're seeing 1 day as the doubling time for positive cases, I can understand the risk-averse position. But it just irrationally feels like OYK keeps jinxing us!"

4802,h5uop5t,Hear hear. They had months to get vaccinated. They themselves said they can't be bothered because they are waiting to die.

4806,h5uoqcu,"I'm glad that despite all our vaccination efforts, the government is still unwilling to open up. This is despite the West already opening up fully, and not suffering any side effects.

Truly, Singapore has such an amazing government that promises to open up then chickens out when cases inevitably spike, like everyone said they would.

Lets not forget how the government is still trying to use the KTV cluster as a scapegoat even though the main spread right now is coming from the fish markets."
4807,h5uoqey,"My guess is government will copy what France did - requiring proof of vaccination to enter cafe, restaurant, shopping centres, etc."

4812,h5uoro1,yeah i finally started exercising regularly and it helped with my mental health and it’s so disruptive to have that routine interrupted:( all the best and keep your head up!! during the last gym closure i tried some at-home hiit and went for long walks or skipping if it helps
4813,h5uory1,Tell that to Israel the UK and US you fucking goof
4814,h5uos63,"He's saying KTV is just a convenient scapegoat. It could have been anyone, anywhere. Churches. TTSH. Changi Airport. JEM cluster. KTV. Jurong fishing port. Do you see? It's easy to blame a place especially one that seems to promote vice but the truth is if it wasn't that, it would have been something somewhere else. Zero covid is not, and will never be, a realistic option and pointing fingers is counterproductive."
4815,h5uos7b,It absolutely is terrible. I have two friends who had to close up shop. They started out full of hope and optimism. Nothing hurts more than seeing your dreams dashed in front of your eyes.
4816,h5uosed,"Oh I get it, I’m pissed too.  If people followed the rules these outbreaks would be small and get under control quickly.

But I guess my point is if the KTV thing didn’t happen it would be something else.  All is takes a tiny crack in defenses to become an outbreak.

Even Australia is dealing with an outbreak and they are even more strict than SG."
4817,h5uospu,Hope everyone remembers that this outbreak is direct fault of SG Govt and their arrogance in thinking KTVs could “pivot” to responsible F&amp;B outlets…

4821,h5uots7,"You're missing the point. OP is saying that a huge cluster was inevitable no matter what. If not the KTV, it would have been something else.

Look at how far more cases are coming out of the fish markets rather than the KTVs right now."

4825,h5uoupx,"Sigh.... I have been dining alone whenever I'm out of my home for the past year and a half... All I needed was a proper place to have a meal and since most of my meals will have to be consumed outside, this only frustrates me more that all these stemmed from imbeciles who deserve to be neutered...

Oh and those who exploited the loophole too, of course."
4826,h5uov4j,Dammit
4827,h5uovf0,"&gt; Easing into endemic was only promised after majority of the eligible population is fully vaccinated ig

Over 50% of the eligible population should have received two doses by now.

&gt; Banning gyms and dining is probably to reduce mask off activities so that the onward transmission from these ports/markets is mitigated

I understand that it definitely reduces onward transmission to some extent, but is the cost of having businesses close down and mental health of people deteriorating worth it? Our ICU is facing less strain than the weeks before."

4835,h5uoxd2,Cant believe the whole of SG got cucked by KTV clubs. Lmao
4836,h5uoxl0,"Oh yes, I agree. I didn’t state my opinion because I thought the numbers spoke for themselves! Unless there has been a mass admission today of vaccinated people, that’s the only way this makes any sense."
4837,h5uoxmg,"Don't bother, this subreddit will just lap up whatever the news said. The government promised no roll back only days before a roll back, and people said I'm the crazy one because I said they don't have a proper plan in place."
4838,h5uoxmm,"Tell me about it. I get that some elderly legitimately can't vaccinate due to medical conditions. My 75 year old grandmother with hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and failing kidneys got vaccinated. So I don't see why some of these elderly who are eligible refuse to do it. You don't get vaccinated solely for your benefit but for those around you as well. I hope these elderly understand that they are being selfish and are a liability to public health."
4839,h5uoxo7,Fuck la I’m so tired alrdy man...
4840,h5uoy0p,"No, the fishmonger cluster shows us where the true vulnerability is. It's easy to scapegoat the KTV cluster, but we still don't know if fishery port spread to KTV or vice versa. And no matter which way it happened, once it reached the fishery port, it went to dozens of wet markets, which are essential businesses that would remain open even with CB. Wouldn't be surprised if some supermarkets are next."
4841,h5uoyi3,"Because the two clusters are linked. KTV and the one in the fishery port
  
Clusters from eateries are inevitable because we need to eat. Clusters from entertainment venues can be avoided because who cares if you can’t sing karaoke? You don’t die from it like you would if you didn’t eat."
4842,h5uoykk,Knn gym close again
4843,h5uozax,Mtf said it started from fish cluster
4844,h5uozhl,Whens it gonna end robbie
4845,h5uozk3,Other way round. The fishery cluster came from the KTV.
4846,h5uoznl,i think the govt knows something we don’t and they’re rly freaking out
4847,h5uozu1,"Its not just the elderly, other age groups (students and young adults) have yet to reach vax level that is high enough as well."

4852,h5up06r,"Can we stop repeating this ""it's not effective"" nonsense?

The point of vaccination is that even if we get covid, we will only have mild sickness and not have to suffer severe covid symptoms?

Why do people keep on repeating this ""not effective"" nonsense?"
4853,h5up0n6,"So parade is still on with a thousand people congregating, but I can’t take my vaccinated family for dinner. Seriously what the f****g s**t. Cancel your NPD or let us out to live our lives."
4854,h5up0ne,"Except you can't. Vaccination has been shown to be nearly 100% successful in totally preventing serious illness, hospitalisation and death. You can still catch it, you can still get the sniffles, you can still spread it but you aren't going to get very sick and you aren't going to die. I don't know where you're getting your information from but it's just wrong."
4855,h5up14v,How? The right thing to do is to vaccinate as per usual and let people continue their lives with mask on until the vaccination target is hit then no need wear mask.
4856,h5up1b8,"Yeah, I wasn't expecting another return to such drastic measures. In fact, I thought the recent Permutations and Combinations type beat shit about """"up to 5 dine-in patrons if all fully vaccinated"""" was the G's attempt at ensuring they wouldn't have to go back on their word! I actually found that heartening; like a ""at least they care about the word they have given"" thing. Alas, that didn't last hahaha.

I wonder if taxation will go up in the near future to account for the severe hits our country has taken? I'm not versed in the ways of economics (proudly flopped it for A Levels, too...) so I'll just wait and see"

Could have been from a drinking establishment, since many of them still don't have safe distancing measures. You telling me that you really need to go out drinking?

The point is that no matter what, a big cluster is inevitable. Its the governments fault for being such fucking cowards and saying that COVID is going to be endemic but locking down at the first sign of trouble."

4905,h5upbae,I’m curious what’s your metric for “doing well”. Let’s define one and then argue.
4906,h5upbb6,"The number is really high. Early birds for 12-39 just started their 2nd dose last week so expect numbers to shoot way up (currently 30% but that's only numbers for 1 week; 80% 1st dose so expect same numbers for 2nd dose).

45-69 already hit 80% full vaccination."
4907,h5upbe5,"Im just afraid this message sent to the public might have a negative feelings towards the benefit of getting vaccinated. On top of that, if seniors dont want to get vaccinated for their own personal reasons, im just afraid that we will be forever stuck in this vicious cycle."
4908,h5upbnk,"I literally just returned from Germany a few days ago (yeah in a sdf now) and I dont see the point of solving this issue using brute force by just simply preventing dining in.

What I saw in Germany was: Only those with proof of vaccination or a schnell-test taken less than 24h ago were allowed to eat in, the rest have to takeaway, why cant such a system be implemented here? Govt says they will treat this like an endemic but judging by their actions its obvious they dont know what they are doing

We have tracetogether too, if we use this app and the vaccinstion proof/covid test proof this can definitely be controlled! This is incompetency at its best once again

Also a personal peeve: Why the 14d requirement for vaccinated travellers?? I got vaccinated back in Germany, got tested before arrival into SG (negative ofc) and the requirements for me is the same as an unvaccinated person? It would make more sense if it were negative test on arrival, only 7 days SDF and a negative test before leaving

This is also where i see the 2nd problem is; there is literally no incentive for getting vaccinated. If you look at Macron's speech about how the unvaccinated are going to be treated and look at the French govt's policies it is clear to see where we are going wrong"

4913,h5upcsg,"So... Do you propose that we lockdown forever? For all eternity? Eternal CB? That's retarded.

The West has already been opening up for months because of their high vaccination rates. What's the point of us vaccinating here if the government isn't going to open up? We might as well all stay home.

Also, is NDP really necessary? Because that's still going on."
4914,h5upcv8,Should have been done long ago. And for KTVs too while we are at it...

My mom is 62, diabetic, on dialysis and is allergic to several types of meds, and recently got the second dose with few complaints. We will eventually open up so we told her that it is for her own safety that she lowers the risk of getting the disease. Sneezing is painful for my mom because of her peritoneal dialysis residual pain every day, so we noted that COVID will make her feel worse than any vaccine in all likelihood. Nothing bad happened in the end. I understand that it can be riskier for some people and this is just my experience. We had also delayed the first vaccination till early June this year."

It was always going to be a progressive change In risk appetite as the vaccination rate increased, which it will every day. They’ve not even got over the first hurdle at the first rise of cases.

4934,h5uphls,"Thank you. This needs to be seen by more people. 

France’s approach incentivises people to get vaxxed ASAP. Ours gives no/little impetus or incentive for people to get vaxxed, especially if being vaxxed means you’re still subject to these restrictions. We really need a change in strategy."

4939,h5upisj,"Yea no cases will still be around. It’ll take some time for it to die off as it continues spreading and natural selection will kill it off as it can barely infect people anymore with the vaccine. But when majority is vaccinated then we can stop tracking covid cases and just track ICU cases because at that point you get covid also heck care because it’s not going to cause u to severely fall ill. But until those who can get vaccinated are all vaccinated, it’s still an inherent risk of someone falling severely ill"

How many have died due to the previous lockdown this year? How many will die because of this coming one? How many lives are we willing to sacrifice to protect the obstinate elderly group and the small, miniscule proportion of people who cannot be vaccinated? 

We need more granular and lenient measures because lockdowns are not holy manna from heaven. They are not bloodless. If we want to be truly empathetic, then we cannot be covid-myopic."

For the sake of your sanity, I'm quite certain I'll be proven right in a few months. No more lockdowns once the target vaccination rate has been reached."
4972,h5upqhg,"If I'm feeling pissed off about the ever-changing rules from our clueless and useless multi-ministry task force, I can only imagine what the guys in the F&amp;B industry are going through. I hope they manage to pull through this."
4973,h5upqjp,"Are you prepared to accept that you cannot sue the government if you had refused vaccination? Are you prepared for the onslaught on reddit for the lack of human rights when the government refuses to pay for the medical bills for those who do not wish to vaccinate? Are you prepared to support the government when the medical staff becomes overwhelmed with cases just because we have folks who refused to vaccinate? Would you still vote for the government just because they open up? I think if our answer is yes, then they will open up."
4974,h5upqsp,"I read something in a UK magazine, regarding the toll covid has had in British care homes. The fact is that if you're in a care home, you are likely unwell to the extent you cannot look after yourself. The writer (a practicing GP and comedian, interesting guy) said that at least since the early days, covid deaths have been peaceful, as they've essentially been medically sedated. He said between a choice of death of dementia or covid, he would choose covid, and ""not every covid death is a tragedy"".

I've thought about it a lot. My grandma died of covid, she had dementia. She was done. Would she have made the choice?

I have sympathy for the old... But not the ""wait and see lah"" kind of people. Enough is enough, if the group most at risk do not want to get vaccinated, that's their right under informed consent. But the rest of us cannot be held to ransom."

4979,h5uprfa,"This 100%. If France, the european symbol for personal freedom, liberty and revolution, is going all for it, all the more an Asian country like us, who puts society above the individual, implement similar penalties who don't vaccinate.

Edit: To the peeps who replied saying, ""oh see la but now the french are protesting and rioting"". Yes that's what the word ""revolution"" means. That means the whole freedom culture is still alive and well in France. That means the policy isn't popular in France. That means that the govt there has decided that the public good this time outweighs personal liberty. That means the situation IS FUCKING SERIOUS. It's like asking Americans to surrender their 1st amendment. If a country like that (France) is asking their citizens to surrender one of their most cherished values, it should give you a glimpse of what needs to be done to exit this whole farce of sudden lockdowns."

OYK says they will consider making COVID vaccines mandatory. But not now as its only under Emergency Authorization from HSA. I believe once it has gained Full Authorization from HSA and all vaccines are available for everyone regardless of their pre-existing conditions or age, they will make it mandatory."
4986,h5uptcl,"It is endemic AFTER the country is sufficiently protected with vaccinations. We are not at that level yet, hence the need to aggressively ring fence the clusters. There is a definite plan, this was always the plan if you actually bothered to understand what the MTF is saying. For every person on these boards that keep harping about a lack of plan, let us see what is your idea of a plan for these times."

4989,h5upun3,"I feel those seniors that doesn't want go for vaccine are selfish. I understand they worry about the side effects and all, but what are the chances they die from side effects? 

We have given them enough time to rethink about getting vaccinated. If they still not keen, get them to sign consent form or something and then move on."
4990,h5upuuz,"I had the same mindset as well, I absolutely hate Lawrence Wong, OYK and the entirety of PAP. OYK literally said, I don't even think it was last week, no reversal of restrictions. And he also said we will be basing new restrictions on ICU numbers instead of cases.         
Well, here we are. ICU still has lots of space left and restrictions are being reversed. They have absolutely no right to declare this as endemic when they clearly are treating this as if its the black death and are especially not even factoring in that 70+% are going to be fully immunized in weeks, which is very near herd immunity."
4991,h5upv6y,"Shouldn't be difficult.

The group of 5 just needs to show their vaccinated status.

All other mix and match combinations are denied."
4992,h5upvbx,only after a good proportion of people are vaccinated...
4993,h5upvq7,pls check the ICU number
4994,h5upvr4,"Fatigue really sets in after awhile. It was going well because people understood and was cooperative. We used to feel united to combat against this virus thats threatening the nation..but right now we’re reaching a breaking point where people start to feel like they’re being punished for the mistake of others. People start blaming a whole race of people. It breaks down all sense of unity among the people. The govt really can’t sustain it too long without considering the societal impact, even if it improves the infection rate. Damn if you do, damn if you don’t I guess."
4995,h5upvvr,"It's not entirely surprising that this is announced as MMTF was eerily silent the past 2 days. Nevertheless, the fact that we're back in this makes it feel like our progress in vaccination so far has been for naught and is disregarded. Not exactly a good message to send, especially since just 4 days ago they gave everyone hope by saying they didn't intend to reverse reopening measures. Not entirely unreasonable given the sharp increase, but still feels like such a slap in the face.

I don't see why we still need to stick to the default period of a full month even after all this time. At least make it two weeks, especially since completely stamping out clusters and infection numbers is increasingly proving to be more effort than it's worth. We don't need to suppress the number back to 0, just snuff out the main driving forces of the exponential growth.

I'm also wondering why they appear to prioritise the yardstick of elderly vaccination as much as they do. I understand that there may be a surge in vaccination or ICU cases if we begin to open up, but it's been months and honestly we have to accept that there's some things we can't prevent no matter how long or hard we try. Our capacity has barely even been tested. On the other end of the spectrum, those unfortunate souls who want to but have yet to be vaccinated are last exactly because they're deemed to belong to the group who can handle the virus the best. My age group are nowhere near as vulnerable as the elderly. I fear that if they wish to continue to peg our reopening purely on elderly vaccination, no matter how good their intentions are, they will never be able to achieve a satisfactory result. And this is coming from someone whose grandparents steadfastly refuse to get jabbed.

If anything, if we want to ""bite this bullet, dial back on social activities, and use this time to push through the vaccination efforts"", **please** give some idea of what we may be looking forward to after National Day so that people at least have something to look forward to. Words may suggest we're nearing the end but actions don't seem to suggest any change from earlier in the year.

I'm not involved in the F&amp;B industry, but I really feel for them as they're getting shitted on time and again by things that's not even their fault. At this rate they're gonna get martyred.

I'm hoping that at least the MMTF is open to policy review and updating of measures halfway through this P2."

5007,h5upy0c,"&gt; Wasn't that what they were saying that the disease is endemic?

It's the plan, once the population reaches a level of vaccination that allows that happen. I think they're aiming for 75% minimum, which is why they ramped up the vaccinations in the last month or so; they really wanted to hit that target for NDP, and probably throw some kind of victory parade then.

5035,h5uq5s8,"The way I understand this, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that unvaccinated people are also a risk to vaxxed people, especially with this particular virus. 

The unvaxxed catching and passing around the virus will lead to further mutations and variants which may lead to one that the vaccine is powerless against. We will already have to take a third maybe even fourth dose of the vaccine to counter the variants that have already emerged. 

It's basically the rate that humans are making vaccines Vs the rate of mutations. In the case of an outbreak, lockdowns buy us time. Vaccination programs buy us time. 

Please do not give up, and encourage people to get vaccinated no matter how crazy you think their views are. 

My 80 yo grandma is among the 'tiny minority' for whom the vaccine would pose a higher risk, and she has not left the house this whole year (other than for doctors appointments).

5102,h5uqpb7,"&gt;Open up once vaccinations are prevalent in Singapore (which they are), and just allow the virus to spread (but not cause any deaths).

That's exactly our plan but 50% vaccination rates are not good enough to protect the people who have not had a chance to be vaccinated and risk overwhelming the health systems. Just because YOU think 50% is good enough doesn't make it so, the R0 numbers are very clear. Soft lockdowns are for the country to make it towards the finish line with as little damage as possible."

I know this sounds selfish but it’s frustrating how we suffer from the irresponsibility of others so only let these stubborn guys suffer lah. We expect that these cases will rise and fall - live with it! Or copy France’s approach or whatever. Walao eh

It's pretty clear that covid can explode into a cluster from almost anything- all it takes is one asymptomatic spreader, even masks don't fully stop the spread. Which is why covid zero is stupid- we will never be able to fully eradicate it. The people who didnt get vaxxed are the real culprits here."
5125,h5uqwp9,For some reason it's about protecting a few that do not want to vaccinate...

I’m also worried about more mutations and more variants, but it’s probably much more likely of that being imported from overseas where they have much larger populations I guess. This wave legit came out of nth in a week or so when there was like 0 cases on one day I think.

I’m sure it’s v stressful for your grandmother to always be at home. Maybe can go nearby park during less crowded timings? Should be relatively safe enough with outdoors air circulation. I’ve also been wondering if we are bored and all at home, it’s probably much worse for the mental health of seniors. 

Seems like it might take quite awhile until we achieve herd immunity, sigh. Its important that those who CAN take the vaccine faster go and take. It’s good to be safe than sorry I guess. Ideally this response can stop the exponential increase in the upcoming weeks and they might loosen restrictions in advance around NDP period. Hope you and your fam stays safe!"

Locking down for another month, putting thousands of jobs and risk is not fair on employees, business owners and the public.

5165,h5urc97,"Undoubtedly! But we're talking about a spectrum of risk.

In 1 week, cases rose ~20x (8 -&gt; 163).

Their strategy is to trace, isolate, and ringfence. At this speed, I’m not quite sure how feasible that is. At some point with current trajectory, you might as well just isolate the whole fucking country and ringfence everyone.

Furthermore, Singapore has a natural disadvantage. We are too fucking densely populated.

Even if there are less vaccinated people developing severe disease, if the delta variant spreads like crazy (which it kinda show it can do so with no problem), it will still put a lot of load on the healthcare system by sheer numbers alone. 

Vaccine reduce the percentage of severe illness but the rates of spread is drastically increased with  the new variants. Who will win? Do you want to treat the whole country as guinea pigs and find out? Also, due to lag, by the time you realise you had lost the upperhand, the problem is already far worse.

Although so far, vaccines don’t appear to be doing badly against delta variant in smaller scales, would you want to treat the whole country as guinea pigs and see if we float or sink?

I can see why they don’t want to risk it.

If anything, I blame the horny bastards and those scums who “pivoted” to “F&amp;B”.

Edit: 

Someone may argue its still okay since ICU is not overloaded. But, remember that the current accelerating rate of spread is already “controlled” by present restrictions. If with many restrictions it is still hurtling towards becoming unsustainable, it is quite obvious other measures need to be imposed to make the rates sustainable. 

That is already with improved ringfencing, testing, isolation, tracing, plus restrictions. Yet the KTV cluster (and its child clusters) remained so explosive.

If you cannot control the rate, ICU usage uptick is just a matter of time and numbers. One could then argue it would then be more humane to act first and prevent unnecessary injury."

5221,h5urvlw,The gov said it was planning for covid to be endemic. Still in the stages of planning. I don't know why people keep acting like covid is supposed to be endemic now or soon. They were very clear about wanting vaccination numbers to be higher first.

In that case ofc inflation would screw that up, but it’s still gonna be the younger generation that pays the price of potential increase in taxes in order to be able to sustain pensions and infra for the older generation.

I’m aware I’m making a lot of assumptions here, but this is how I see it"
5229,h5urxw6,"My point is that there will always be an argument for keeping restrictions. At 75% it'll be 90%, at 90% it'll be 95%.

5231,h5uryg2,"My wedding is in 2 weeks after being postponed twice. We decided to just have the ceremony and a nice dinner at Lavo by ourselves on our wedding night. Also cancelled.

ETA: We are both healthcare workers. My fiance was smack in the middle of the molecular lab for covid testing in a hospital and I saw patients everyday to do their routine tests. I resigned and moved to a bigger hospital because I wanted to do more for the healthcare system. And we can't even have a 2-person dinner in a nice restaurant for our wedding.

I'm not just disappointed, I'm totally heartbroken."
5232,h5uryyf,"Physical force shouldn’t be used.

You may want to strongly emphasise the benefits of vaccination and educate them on the actual risks of vaccination. If you pay their phone bill, cut it off if they get their misinformation from there. Then progress to giving them the silent treatment, reducing monthly support to the minimum required to skirt filial piety laws, stop visiting them and stop calling them if they are refusing to vaccinate due to a stupid reason. What’s a stupid reason - that’s up to you to decide.

This won’t work if you’re not supporting them haha.

You are setting up perverse incentives - which is to do Melbourne style immediate full lockdowns at any sign of infection, rather than “disappointing” people who **demand** certainty in an uncertain situation."

5239,h5us22i,"Lmao what an idiot. No ones saying that unvaccinated folks are 2nd class citizens, but the whole point is that we get majority herd immunity so we don’t have to go back and forth LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW. 

No shit you can still get Covid after taking the doses and transmit it, but if people are vaccinated, the chances are lower. I’m also saying this because the gov won’t anyhow ask people to take the vaccine if it hasn’t been fully checked by HSA first. It’s quite safe, but some idiots are just so scared to take it, and because of them, this is one reason why the gov has to push back the entire country back to P2. Because you have horny fucks who go KTV and the spread of the virus at the markets. 

You don’t wanna vaccinate? OK, then don’t expect us to even remotely go back to how life was, in 5 years. It will remain as P2-P3 back and forth because the virus will never end at the pandemic stage."
5240,h5us2or,"What is the point you are trying to make? Would you like to layer the death rates next to those figures? Or how about look up the most conservative of estimates of vaccination rates for herd immunity?

Talk is worth shit."
5243,h5us4h2,"They are going backwards? Endemic is not a magic number, it’s a risk appetite where you are happy with an acceptable level of community spread that doesn’t overwhelm hospitals and cause mass death. 

We have 50% double jabbed with that increasing every day. There is 1 person in ICU. I’m sure they would love to have got to national day and 66% without an outbreak but we’ve fallen a few weeks short. What will this lockdown achieve that we wouldn’t have faced in 3 weeks anyway? Why are cases bad today but not in 3 weeks? Where is the modeling that shows the difference that the decision today will make on healthcare?"
5244,h5us4pn,The government is scared the death of the older gen is the death of their votes.

5246,h5us4wb,"Mr Gan, who co-chairs the task force, said that given the rate at which new clusters are growing, tougher measures are necessary to slow the spread of the virus to give time to raise vaccination coverage, especially among the elderly.

Also as for making covid-19 endemic,

5247,h5us53e,Does it mean HBL is back?
5248,h5us5pn,Yes. But don't forget there are 2 more weeks after 2nd dose to take effect to be considered complete.

To any French person who happen to be one of those who protested against Macron for this decision, I'll have you know that the international community supports Macron's decision (there are some protesters holding placards to [urge the international community to oppose Macron](https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-health-government-and-politics-france-d25494f4cf4ca6c6d1464188a89ece6f)). Your government is giving you a key to salvation that many in other less fortunate countries are dying for, yet you still reject it in the name of liberty? Sure you can have freedom, __but not at the cost of others!__ If you still insist on not getting vaccinated for reasons other than medical issues, then you can continue to have your freedom...in hell.

5252,h5us7cq,"My point is that we’re vaccinating the population at least once far too slowly.

5253,h5us7mv,"I like to read the constant bitching of us Singaporeans. Most only read news and never stayed abroad before. So the sentiment is always ""our gov is the worse"".

Yet open any youtube video on singapore's handling of covid and you will see floods of foreigners praising our country for how well we cope with covid and our death rate is really low because of how well our gov cope with covid.

They are not perfect. But reading reddit makes it seem like singapore have the worst government in the world.

Singapore cannot experiment with people's lives. Ive read a few comments above saying, we have to accept a couple of death and just open up like UK.

Some even said want to migrate to US. Hello friend, if you look chinese, US is the worst possible place to be at today.

Just bear with it for a while. We're already at 50%. Just 20 more% and the gov can follow up with their plan.

There's even a healthcare worker that calmly states, we cannot afford to have a sudden influx of people entering hospital due to covid. Our healthcare will suffer. We cannot cope with that."

Sure! 115 deaths in the UK. Of a population of 66 million. Want compare some more?

&gt;Or how about look up the most conservative of estimates of vaccination rates for herd immunity?

According to professionals, herd immunity is near *impossible* to obtain because the virus is constantly mutating and the vaccine only prevents deaths rather than containing the spread.

&gt;Just because other countries are opening themselves up against the advice of science doesn't make it smart to follow.

5272,h5userf,"I am a novice, just a (previously) enthusiastic gym goer. So my unprofessional personal opinion is that we can consider resistance band training.

This reddit thread is one starting point for learning about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ResistanceBand/comments/fnyk7f/how\_to\_switch\_from\_weightlifting\_at\_the\_gym\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResistanceBand/comments/fnyk7f/how_to_switch_from_weightlifting_at_the_gym_to/) 

My additional two cents of caveats:

Buy good quality bands. There are different qualities of resistance bands being sold. Based on my googling and reading reviews, many bands snap with minimal use. Also, many of the exercises involve anchoring to an external fixture e.g. a door, but this may damage the fixture/cause injury if the external fixture is not strong/the anchor is not fixed properly to the door.

 \[This is not a sponsored post.\] For me, I bought a set of Undersun resistance bands (google Undersun resistance bands on amazon), which from reviews (amazon, reddit, etc.) seem to be of a good quality. (I've only used them three times so far, so cannot speak from personal experience how durable they are, but they do seem to be of ok quality.) I don't use the door anchor, as I don't want to damage the doors, or risk having the door fly out when I'm doing a chest fly and have it smack me at the back of my head. No need to go for their workout subscription, imho, you can just youtube James Grage (e.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_nT3G-5f74k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nT3G-5f74k)) for different types of workouts. 

They won't replace your weights for sure, but so far they do seem to give my muscles a decent workout. Just remember that unlike weights, the maximum tension is felt at the end of the movement, so don't be in a rush to go back to your starting position once you reach the end in order to get the most of the workout."

FYI, I stand to benefit if more foreigners enter our country, but only if they are entering safely and free from COVID. That obviously isn't working very well and all the so called safeguards and procedures by the government hasn't been able to control it well. 

&gt;The current cluster spread from a vietnamese national.

That's the point. I don't care if they are Vietnamese or American or Indian or Chinese. I care if it is safe to do so. It isn't safe. It wasn't safe. It has been proven time and time again that it has never been safe.

The reason for this is because if the crazy spike in numbers and how the Gov needs to get it under control seeing as how we've gone into triple digitt whilst only having around 50% or less of the population fully vaccinated.

5340,h5utyr6,"I do know about the ICU. I mean if that is considered as revealing about severity of the cases(in full), then this act of no dining makes no sense.

I mean it specially noted that of all 6 severe cases, none of them are vaccinated. Is that trying to push for ppl to take vaccine or just bad phrasing(ie We nv mentioned about the others cuz none of it is severe)? The bigger question is why are they having such huge reaction if the rest of 289-6 are not showing symptoms or just mildly sick.

Their action seems contradictory to a scenario of 289 infected, only 6 are of concern with 1 being dire."

When the KTV cluster was announced last week, many of us had pointed out that this was going to explode. People will not come forward, the virus will spread. And we were still under 50% fully vaccinated.

The government waited an entire week to respond to this. What did you fucking expect? Things to magically get better? 

Now that things are out of control, you react and enact measures for an entire month. 

I'm pissed at the irresponsible assholes who went to the ktvs. I'm pissed at the owners that kept their ktvs running, they deserve jail time. I'm most pissed at the government, who have been so disappointing recently, taking more reactive than active measures."

Otherwise, what is the end game? Can we ever open up again?"
5349,h5uu5x2,"Whats the use of vaccination and lockdowns.  

Look at Israel and UK covid cases, they got higher vaccination rates than us.  If vaccines are so effective then there should not be an uptrend in new cases.  Don't blame it on Delta variant, there's gonna be more new variants in the future, are we going to lockdown every time a new variant emerges??"
5350,h5uu83a,"Ontario allows for indoor dining despite having similar vaccination rates as Singapore. Cases remain very low. This does not make sense at all.

5351,h5uu8nd,"Just do these:

- only those who are fully vaccinated for over 2 weeks, ~~and~~ *or* have exemption signed by a registered medical doctor can dine in

This give you the hint that it is all politically motivated. In 2 weeks 200 cases per day will be *""all good and OK""*. Now, 160/170 cases today is **really bad.**

Maybe not take medical away but just restrict the movement or accessibility for non-vaccinated folks and it should help increase vaccination numbers to an extent where COVID-19 is decidedly endemic, and only a small numbers are non-vaccinated for whatever reasons. 

Oh and they should have brought in restrictions the moment KTV cluster came out… reduce everyone’s suffering by a week or so as we can end this earlier. Also, maybe OYK should keep silent these days.. ;-)"

Well I think these people should be at the back of the queue for available ICU beds, priority should go to the people who can't be vaccinated (including the younger people who haven't had the opportunity to get the shots earlier).

Couple of other points I'd support in any online petition :)

1. Transfer NDP funds to support FnB and other businesses affected. [And just cancel NDP](https://www.change.org/p/cancel-singapore-national-day-parade-ndp-2021/f)
2. Update the Healthhub app to register if a doctor has advised you to not use an mRNA vaccine. Then treat all vaccinated and exempt people differently from those who are unvaccinated-by-choice

edit: to include Cancel NDP petition"

2 weeks later we are back to phase 2.

Indeed we got a community cluster like never before probably. But let vaccinated people live their lives unless there are other rules that we aren't aware of.

That's exactly what it means though, depending on the vaccine. Some vaccines reduce transmission by a lot, which is how you obtain herd immunity AFAIK. Human rabies, for example, mostly doesn't exist anymore because everyone is vaccinated against it.

I'm not saying that the covid vaccine isn't effective against covid, just that it might not be very effective in protecting against transmission. Important to know the diff, otherwise normal people will see covid transmission still happening and think the vaccine is completely ineffective."

we cannot keep waiting for the magical zero cases day since that will never come up.

we should also have more empathy for our seniors who do not want to get vaccinated. at the end of the day, this is a medical choice and they have the freedom to take or not take the vaccine. The people to be blamed are those imposing these lockdowns on millions of people without any concern for one's personal liberties or the country's progress. good decisions are all about trade-offs and SG needs to move on at some point and act like it when it says that covid-19 is 'endemic'."

There was **always** going to be another outbreak, regardless of its source, especially with the contagious Delta variant circulating. The question was: how will the Singapore G respond to it?

5541,h5uznbl,"I think the immediate issue is that they take up hospital beds, which means worse care if you need to go to the hospital for non-covid reasons. Lots of people in this thread talking like we can just wheelbarrow these unvaccinated sick old people into a ditch and call it a day."

If I am to ""spread"" anything, it is to compare the strategy of opening up vs locking down, UK vs NZ. (I'm not against vaccines, I'm getting my 2nd jab on Thursday, in case you want to accuse me of that too.) What I'm against is the belief that vaccines is the only solution, and other things are no longer needed. And now again I'm talking about UK and Freedom Day here, the strategy to remove all restrictions because vaccination goals have been met, vs the NZ strategy to keep the whole country clean, not whatever other point you want to attribute to me.

Otherwise, with high rental and no income, all the staff gotta go unpaid leave."

5576,h5v0t0q,"to vaccinate or not is a personal choice, we can never expect everyone to want to get vaccinated in a country - that is absurd. the old people do not owe us anything. the problem here really is that we are not able to face the truth that we will not hit zero cases even when 90 or 100 percent of SG is vaccinated. clusters have formed at various points of the year consistently regardless of vaccination status as well. the truth is covid-19 is endemic and we should act like it. that is the root of the problem here - that we are panicking on the smallest uptick of cases and imposing draconian measures on millions of lives at will."

5586,h5v1ajo,"Lol that’s emotional abuse? They’re not entitled to any communication unless they decide to be like actual adults and get vaccinated, unless they have a valid reason not to be. It’s totally their choice to get vaccinated just as it is the children’s choice to want to continue to support selfish people who are fine with infecting themselves and threatening the lives of the truly immunocompromised in this country.

They can support themselves and live on their own if they are so stubborn. People who do socially irresponsible things should not be enabled by others."

Emotional abuse is a way to control another person by using emotions to criticize, embarrass, shame, blame, or otherwise manipulate another person.

I don't care whether you think it's abuse or not, neglecting your parents in order to get them to be vaccinated is manipulation, and in turn, is emotional abuse.

So no, the previous paragraph was about justifying the treatment but never have I agreed with you that it was abuse.

Next!

Edit: I’m guessing y’all think the government implementing different restrictions for vaccinated and unvaccinated people is abuse too since it is “manipulation” to effect a change in behaviour lol"

5623,h5v344z,This!! Singapore must lift all restrictions including wearing masks after 85% of Population has been vaccinated. Life must continue as the virus will continue to be around for the next 1000 years. We just have to live with it just like we do with the seasonal flu.

But as someone from the 12-39 batch who just got my 2nd dose and know people who are waiting for their 2nd dose, I'm actually glad we are returning to phase 2 for now. People are baying about letting those who have chose to be unvaccinated face the consequence of their choices, but how about those of us who have chose to be vaccinated but are just not fully vaccinated **yet**? And then, there are also those who did not choose to not get vaccinated for medical reasons etc. Should we not be a little more mindful of them? 

It's a most unfortunate timing that we are still strongly in the middle of our vaccination exercise, and I would like to believe that if this spike in cases had occurred after most of those who want to be vaccinated have been fully vaccinated, the measures taken by the government would be very different. I certainly hope that this will not remain the same in the future and it would be nice if the government can clarify their plan for the future even if it comes with caveats for possible changes. 

In my opinion, the true disappointment about the way our government is handling the situation is not the constantly changing measures in response to the constantly changing situation, but the lack of clarity on our overall plan for the future. Take away the ambiguity and give us some hope, and the restrictions of the present may be easier to endure."

No dining in is very inconvenient for people who are not office workers"

What happened to them saying they'll now view the pandemic as endemic? 

We've had so many businesses crash and burn, people committing suicide from loneliness, people losing their livelihoods from various sectors and ALL FOR WHAT??! 

Just to avoid 1 or 2 more covid-related deaths from 90+ y/o elderlies who are probably gonna die from a stroke or something sooner or later anyway?

I avoid crowds when going out, but there are some occasions that I'm willing to take a risk for. The point here is that people in our situation have a choice about whether to go out or not. If you are afraid of contracting the virus, stay home and get those in the same household to do the same. Isn't that a lot less selfish than imposing upon literally millions of people?"

5656,h5v4yy7,"Even if everyone is vaccinated, there will still be Covid and deaths. There are more vaccinated Covid cases now in Israel than unvaccinated. You can keep twisting the narrative to suit your agenda. Old people with underlying conditions are always at a high risk to die, they should be the ones vaccinated. Younger folk who are healthy shouldn’t need to get mandatory vaccinations. Especially when it’s being proven that the vaccine is useless against the delta variant and requires booster jabs. Fucking bullshit useless vaccine"

If we treat them and run out of capacity, what do we do when the next person ineligible for the vaccine (kid, cancer recovery patient, people allergic to pain killers) needs a bed. Kick them out on the curb to die? 

You are right, that sucks though…"

and yeah im damn pissed too, some of my favourite places closed and i can only pour so much money in

tbh, if they know they're vulnerable and still dw get vaccinated then just die lol (coming from a healthcare worker)

yeah, wish the govt can handle this shit better but they see some increase and get scared to shit

haiz, hope you're doing okay though with all this"
5660,h5v575b,You know how you can keep yourself safe? Just be a bit more cautious for 2 more weeks till your next dose. The fact that we opened up and then closed tells you the govt is not serious about living with the virus

You clowns can keep thinking that you are protected by the vaccine. Vast majority of unvaccinated people recover from Covid like the flu, yet now the narrative has shifted to you have to vaccinate, if not you will get severe Covid. Such bullshit"
5675,h5v61ak,"No. I firmly believe that as the vaccination numbers go up we can ignore the unvaccinated elderly number a lot more.

It's just that now, with the unvaccinated elderly numbers (some really cannot vaccinate due to medical reasons not because they read some silly article) and the overall numbers, the potential risks is probably higher than what is 'tolerable'.

Hence why the super prudence."

5682,h5v6lvp,"really? what country is this? is the delta strain the dominant strain in your country? 

as for evidence: Here's the Washington Post quoting Mark Williams, dean of the Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences : ""“That’s just indicative of the more virulent quality of the delta variant,” Williams said. “It will make people sick, even people that are young and would not have felt any consequence from the original wild variant.”  
Frighteningly, he said, far more children are being hospitalized, which was very rare until recently. As of mid-July, a dozen children were in Arkansas Children’s Hospital, he said, and two were on ventilators.""

5705,h5v7uwg,how hard is it to stay at home damnit
5706,h5v7z6e,"One stupid reason is that the vaccine was rushed.

It's not rushed. Other vaccines take a long time to develop because:

a) not enough funding
b) not enough subjects

With the global pandemic we have countries throwing money into developing the vaccine and abundant areas to hold the trials.

But oh well, who needs science when 'they are the ones who know the truth'"
5707,h5v7zye,"I understand the frustration. It is hard to determine the right milestone when the virus keeps changing (and for the worse). For example, before Delta we thought ~75% vaccination would give us herd immunity (based on the relatively low R0 of the earlier variants, and the ~94% efficacy of the vaccine at stopping transmission). And that would obviously be a huge thing, since with herd immunity you don't need to worry about the immunocompromised given that the virus stops circulating. But Delta has a huge R0 and reduces vaccine efficacy to the point that herd immunity appears impossible. The virus will continue to circulate and the immunocompromised are gonna be perpetually at risk. The big question is: how much risk do you think is appropriate for these people?"

5712,h5v85wo,"&gt; The big question is: how much risk do you think is appropriate for these people?

The same amount as they had before the pandemic for every other disease. They are such a small percentage of the population it makes no sense to restrict everyone else just for them.

Personally, I believe Singapore is already there."
5713,h5v8ahs,it’s mainly due to having little or no support given by government this time. landlords and food court management unwilling to give any rebate as well.

And by the way there is already many ways the govt and society is taking care of these vulnerable people. If they dont want to vax and yet want to have freedom to roam around when others can then yeah sorry I have no empathy for that."
5721,h5v8oa1,"&gt;it feels more and more like there is a story underneath what is being mentioned 

There's always an ulterior motive, it's politics. But this sort of statement is borderline ridiculous. So in 2 weeks the people who got vaccinated today with its second dose will be considered ""covered"" how does that change anything?

If there is a parade it will be sold as a fantastic achievement of resilience. When in reality it feels like, it's more of the same as they were planning along for the inevitable increases but with a fabricated milestone which could have been reached any other day.

It's the idea of progress more than progress itself that's being peddled.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all in for people being vaccinated and safe as fast as possible. It's on my own interest. Looking forward to go back, but this news is utter softcore populism."

5723,h5v8qqx,"Talking about seniors. 70+ is the group with the low numbers (albeit not that low, 70%). 60-69 is the really high vaccination rates.

Here for example:

&gt;Around half of Singapore's population are fully vaccinated, but there are around 200,000 who are aged 60 and above who are yet to be vaccinated. They are in the group at a high risk of falling critically ill once infected.

&gt;Links to a large cluster at KTV lounges and lack of attention paid to mask wearing turned Singapore's main fishery port into a hotbed of Covid-19 infection, **those who work there said**.  
&gt;  
&gt;**It is understood** that a KTV hostess who recently tested positive for the virus had worked at the port. Some workers there are also patrons of lounges.

Even if true, it doesn't say whether KTV spread to fishery port or fishery port spread to KTV.

The official news from MOH based on sequencing data is that the variant probably came from Indonesian fishing boats i.e. fishery port got hit first.

3. Retail sale of ART test kits and to self test as a precaution

4. Increased vaccination for all SGreans + foreigners

Surely they have to wait for us 12-39ers to get both shots and be protected right. Also, those screaming for measures to be relaxed seem to have forgotten that everyone under 12 is literally unvaccinated and at the mercy of how the rest of us handle the outbreak. So yes, if all these kids want things open and measures relaxed, do it based on a scientific approach that is equitable to all age groups and not cry foul over how they ve had their ass vax for so long and still havent smelt freedom. Those are days they got their immunity ahead of the rest of us whilst we drove the economy and bore the brunt of the risk first. Finally, I doubt there is any study where a country successfully opens with the delta variant around where only 40ish% of the population had two shots in."

Singapore has handled COVID very well during 2020 with the CB (a bit late but ok) but since has been hibernating on a clear strategy. Look at France and the post here in this thread. That’s the way to do it. 85% fully vaccinated and then open everything.

5766,h5vbqa9,"I don't think you understand the situation. It's not that they don't want to vax. It's that the vax does not work for them due to preexisting medical conditions, like having done chemotherapy."

But you wanna try telling me why these people can't just stay in and lockdown with their family (like the rest of the country has been forced to all this while) if the country opens up for the rest of us? Is it because it would be unfair? That's exactly what I meant when I said this is just FOMO."

5816,h5veiog,"pareil, bro"
5817,h5vevbk,"It’s not missing the point. Let me explain. The reason KTV is being blamed, apart from the “vice reason”

1) Social distancing was not followed. Hawker centre and restaurants follow stricter social distancing norms. Waiters don’t come and sit on your lap. 

2) The hostesses were coming in contact with multiple people and went to multiple KTVs. In hawkers centres and restaurants Mixing within groups is disallowed. 

3) Hawkers and restaurants are essential both from a demand and supply perspective. KTVs are not. Still the government in order to let the KTV owner avoid financial stress, allowed them to pivot to F&amp;B business. Had they followed the guidelines as per norms, no one would have objected even if there was a cluster. But the behaviour of KTV owners was akin to biting the same hand that feeds you. Hostesses for an F&amp;B business are absolutely unnecessary. 

So overall, while rest of the F&amp;B establishments struggled, people adjusted to groups of dining into 2, people with infants were not able to dine out at all. So while a majority of singapore was adhering to norms, few people washed out all the efforts due to their selfish motives. 

Again a cluster could form in hawker center for example. But unless and until there was rampant violation of social distancing norms no one would blame the cluster. If KTV became a cluster in spite of following all norms, shouldn’t have been an issue. But the blatant violation of norms led to a spike in cases in small amount of time, which might impact the tipping point of the wave curve, and has already gotten us back into phase 2, which is why there is a lot of disappoint and resentment against the KTV. We have the highest number of daily community cases just because of few selfish people."
5818,h5vezgi,"I agree. I was just contrasting the fact that we are vaccinating out way our, but it’s still obviously not good enough for those making the decisions."
5819,h5vf78p,"In the same group too. Unlike you, I took my 2nd dose last Sunday. I have a vax centre (pfizer) 2 minutes from my house, I chose to travel to Yew Tee (other choice was Gombak) for Moderna shot. Why? To get vaccinated as soon as possible.

When gahmen first announced 2 for unvaccinated, 5 for vaccinated dine in, I was disappointed. I was supposed to meet my friends for makan yesterday. But it's okay. We just reschedule to 1 week later. Well whoops.

I totally agree on your last paragraph."

I don't know how French citizens view vaccinations, I am American, and there's an assumption that those who don't want to be vaccinated are ""distrustful"" or simply hard headed.

""It's a matter of individual responsibility, but also of personal freedom."" Yes I agree, so maybe not restrict those who are utilizing their personal responsibility and freedom to decide a vaccine isn't for them. I find this frustrating. How have we moved so far away from personal discretion when it comes to this issue?"
5834,h5vgdld,"Nobody trusts the government at this point.

5835,h5vgid4,"&gt; Cessation of Mask-Off Activities

&gt; 9. To reduce the risks of community transmission, both indoor and outdoor dine-in F&amp;B establishments (including hawker centres and food courts) will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. **Strenuous indoor exercise classes, or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities, will also cease.** In addition, personalised services which require masks to be removed (e.g. facials, saunas, make-up services), singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind or brass instruments) will also not be allowed. These restrictions will not apply to medical and dental consultations that require patients to have their masks removed. Non-medical facial treatments will not be exempted from these restrictions.

My guess is the bolded part points to no."
5836,h5vh2pd,"this is why the government should have communicated a reopening plan early.

state the stats they are looking at for reopening, state the stats they are looking at for tightening. that gives us more confidence that there is a plan, and also shows us that they aren't flip flopping.

unfortunately all we have is ""we look at ICU capacity"", which has turned out to be false.

dunno what the task force is doing."

And no matter which way it happened, once it reached the fishery port, it went to dozens of wet markets, which are essential businesses that would remain open even with CB. Wouldn't be surprised if some supermarkets are next.

Er, the fishery port cluster started because someone there went to KTV.

But any country that's completely isolated got their economy whacked... It's the American version (pre vaccines) of do you choose less victims and more bankruptcy, or functioning economy and prepare for high death count (and hope vaccines get created).

I don't think there's a clear cut ""correct"" answer. But we all have to live with the consequences."

-	Remove SafeEntry
-	Alcohol sales after 10:30pm
-	No mask outdoor
-	No mask indoor
-	No quarantine for travelers 
-	Remove re-entry permits requirements 
-	No limit on group sizes
-	Nightclubs can open

A small minority of fully vaccinated BNT162b2 recipients might still develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infection despite the vaccine's high effectiveness, with need for in-patient care. This representative cohort of hospitalized patients is characterized by older age, high rate of co-morbidities predisposing for progression to severe COVID-19 and a high rate of immunosuppression. The outcome of these patients was similar to that of non-vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additional prospective longitudinal studies are urgently needed to identify predictors for vaccine breakthrough infection and simple correlates of vaccine protection, to enable identification of individuals at higher risk, who would require continued strict precautions, and possibly repeated active vaccination or other prophylactic measures, such as passive vaccination. Furthermore, indirect protection of vulnerable individuals is best achieved by mass vaccination leading to herd immunity."

this resonated with me so much. i feel like they are not really acknowledging or much less understanding a lot of the frustrations we have now. vaccinated or not, i still need to suffer the stupid rules set by the gov because of those who don't want the jab or stupid people that think they're smart by being all ""haha i wait and see"". why the heck is the gov being so patient with the people who refuse to get vaccinated? they're the fkin leaders of this country and most sporeans are obedient ducks so if they mandate vaccination we confirm hit like 90% a long time ago pls. how are we ever going to get out of this situation if it depends on vaccination rate but vaccination is voluntary and people are being lazy/unnecessarily paranoid/stubborn? do they think they're being jesus by showing ""unconditional love"" to the 200k burden seniors that didn't get jabbed? ""you chose not to jab. it's ok i forgive u and will protect u in exchange for the livelihoods of all businesses in SG and the mental health of our vaccinated countrymen"".

...or maybe they're living such comfy lives that they don't feel the same frustration we do when all these restrictions come into place and we're no longer able to move about freely. maybe they have their own chef, swimming pool, gym, and golf course. even if everything outside closes they're not affected so they don't feel anything at all putting back restrictions again.

seriously. vaccinated people should get some form of compensation for having to suffer with the stupid black sheep. at first thought there's advantage because of the ""groups of 5 for vaccinated pax"" but in the end some restaurants just do a blanket 2 pax/table because it's more convenient, and then it got cancelled after just 3 days. zzz. cancel next year's NDP and use the money give angpow to everyone who followed the rules and all the businesses who had to suffer cos of the repeated flip flops. thanks.

also, can't imagine if this is the level of frustration on the ground, how must the migrant workers living in the dorms be feeling right now cooped up in the same place for god knows how many months. come to think, wasn't the number of suicides higher than the number of deaths from COVID in SG even since pandemic started? how can they keep doing this to us without providing any mental health resources or something liddat.....

We cannot be in forever lockdown."

5889,h5voa4e,"Don't you think it would make a more compelling historical narrative if we intentionally forego one NDP as a show of solidarity with the rest of the world who are struggling through this with us, and a symbolic gesture to citizens that we place greater importance on the people than empty bells and whistles?

If we took a stand and cancelled NDP, it'd go down in our (shitty) social studies textbooks as a moment of galvanization for the country. Instead, we're going to have some half-assed truncated skeleton version which nobody will talk about *the day after*, let alone in subsequent years."

I sacrificed 2 years of my time for the greater good of this country's defence. Don't tell me that unvaccinated people can't do something much less, and much simple because it's ""their choice"". It wasn't my choice to do NS either."
5891,h5vor9p,Because I don't like watching F&amp;B and other businesses struggle while the government forces children to dance and sing like fucking oompa loompas?
5892,h5voszp,"The problem is you think its just a little longer.

It is obvious right now that this government has zero risk appetite, and nothing will ever be good enough for them. After all vaccinated and if they even ditch those who chose not to vaccinate, the government will point towards the kids and those who cannot be vaccinated. And then point towards the need for a booster. And then point to the need of opening borders before restoring civil liberties because Singapore's survival depends on it.

The government has no concept of accounting for the mental wellbeing or opportunity costs or any other intangible negative impacts these lockdowns have. And that it impacts the younger generation disproportionately while they are the least at risk is just irony at its best."
5893,h5vov99,"Correct, Lithuania. 
And yes we had more deaths per 1mil population despite strict quarantine, masks mandates etc. compared to Sweden where was not quarantine, and masks only recommended in the public transport during rush hour.

5895,h5voxvu,"yup i was referring to ACTUAL contraindications that some people struggle with, not trivial ones. i know of an elder who has heart complications and was advised by a professional to not go for the vaccination. only in cases like this would it be really unfair for them, because like i said in my original comment, most of these vulnerable people do actually want to get vaccinated."

5897,h5vp6ie,Our vaccination rate is pretty good compared to other developed countries. The only difference is that our govt is prioritising the unvaxxed over the vaxxed.  Which is pretty stupid imo

5904,h5vpqcz,"Three quarters of Singapore have gotten the 1st dose. And let's bear in mind that Singapore is a small island nation surrounded by huge neighbours. Many ASEAN foreigners would wanna seek better paying jobs here. So there is a high susceptibility that a few undetected cases from neighbouring countries might have slipped through customs undetected. There are 2 main clusters right now, one at a fishery port where there could be intermingling between Malaysian and Indonesian fishermen and another at a KTVs where a handful of Singaporean men intermingled with Viet/Burmese hostesses."
5905,h5vps27,Exactly. Another quarantine anyone?...
5906,h5vptyx,"Paying taxes is only 1 of the responsibilities of a citizen. I'm sure you agree we have other responsibilities like following the law, not causing a nuisance , helping out fellow citizens etc. The unvaxxed don't automatically get all the rights just coz they pay taxes."
5907,h5vpz2y,"Technocratic, but still somewhat beholden to public sentiment.

There are 3 main flavours of vaccine hesitancy

Rushed narrative: it was so rushed, I don't want to be big pharma's guinea pig

Sinophile: I don't trust these western vaccines, Sinovac only for me (Despite Indonesia's numbers showing significantly reduced efficacy)

Math challenged: 7 people I heard of got cardiac arrest (of millions vaccinated), I don't want that kind of risk.

Making it mandatory would be politically unpopular, until the wave of public sentiment makes it a slamdunk. The most that's happened so far is increased convenience/access for vaccinated people, but that arguably isn't enough of an incentive/disincentive so far."
5908,h5vpz5z,"Truth is we aren't protected by vaccines coz you clowns are too stupid to take them. But I agree, it's our fault for even giving you guys a choice and let you walk all over the rest of us"

The MMTF have demonstrated they are a group of incompetent clowns and totally unfit to lead the country, much less in a crisis. As a young generation Singaporean, I know I'm not alone in my sentiment of being desperate to leave. Something needs to change, fast."
5910,h5vq2i7,"&gt;there has to be more empathy for everyone in the country

I agree, and would like to add that there should be more empathy from the following:

5915,h5vqlj2,"I begin to understand the frustration toward people who choose to be unvaccinated when it's framed in such a way. You had to make sacrifices, our world was utterly changed, and it's been framed in such a way that being vaccinated is the only way to return to our life. Those who go unvaccinated are not willing to make the same sacrifice. I feel that nobody needed to make a sacrifice at all, and that our life being brought to a halt was arbitrary and unnecessary, a result of incompetence on behalf of lawmakers and social influence. You and your siblings should have the life you're hoping for, but so should somebody who just doesn't want a vaccine. It's likely that we're all going to be okay. Exercise caution at your own risk, but again, it's likely we're all going to be okay. I'm sorry you had to sacrifice so much, I feel for you. I beg that you sit and think about who you should be truly frustrated with, your common people or those who changed everything in our lives because of incompetence and greed"

5924,h5vr6yl,"I'm curious, I thought Singapore was well vaccinated?"
5925,h5vr8fb,"Medically, vaccination makes sense. It is a medical subject. Those who are at risk, those who are with at-risk individuals should consider the medical implication of a vaccine. But socially pushing people in either direction detracts from the true meaning of a vaccine, which is medical. There should not be a social consequence for not wanting a vaccine. Social consequences for getting/not getting a vaccine are why people are choosing not to get it. Nobody likes being pushed into a corner. I don't write any of this with attitude either. If countries want to see true progress with vaccines, they have to let people choose for themselves and rid the social implications of this vaccine and these restrictions"
5926,h5vrd6o,"Ok, good, I totally understand that point. I’m frustrated too as well, and I totally get that it’s frustrating there are groups of people not willing to take vaccination as a serious consideration. But I think we also have look at the point where restrictions don’t become discriminatory or complicated for the vulnerable people (ie unvaccinated = restricted from dining out or having social life) simply because they legitimately cannot, or worse still backstabbed by people faking underlying conditions to avoid vaccinations. And we’re at the crossroads where a new variant exposes even more vulnerabilities even among the vaccinated groups. 

All I think is, rather than making blanket statements about opening up and leaving the unvaccinated behind, we have to manage this entire situation and allow the vaccination programme to carry on, until there’s a strong enough herd immunity effect (scientifically and convincingly backed) that we can safely allow the vulnerable people be a part of the new norm as well. This flip-flopping is indeed frustrating, let’s just hope that since we’ve managed it before, we’ll manage it again."

This is however not the case. It is profitless teasing “medical” from “social” because the effects are inextricably intertwined, and no one lives in a vacuum."

5935,h5vt15t,"we all agree that covid is endemic and something that we'll need to live through. and a substantial population is fully vaccinated (and soon greater than 50% will be fully vaccinated)

as such, the government and conservative population needs to look further and longer-term than these short-term measures. it's time to look forward to the social and economic recovery that the world has endured for over 1.5 years. we need to learn to move forward and live with this virus - and there should be no need to shut down the country and society when the cases continue to have limited hospital impact. our barometer for success or failure should be revised - a few months ago, i read that singapore might stop recording daily case counts. that would be a good start to moving forward to designing new KPIs on how to measure covid impact

by changing how we frame the covid impact, we can stop moving backwards"
5936,h5vt2b5,What's KTVs?
5937,h5vt6dp,"KTV is a social service that we have, it’s where people go to booths and sing karaoke together. Behind closed doors, it’s also where prostitution/sex work thrives. 

When we opened up slightly last month, F&amp;Bs were allowed to operate and KTVs ran under “F&amp;B”s. However, some restrictions weren’t followed because of.. horny reasons. Recently, some hostesses spread covid amongst several clients and now the virus is spreading pretty rampantly again :(

Edit: it could also have been the clients who spread it to the hostesses. Thanks for pointing that out."

5940,h5vttdo,Basically a place to sing songs. Those involved in the cluster had some sleazy stuff going on.

I know that to even be able to make this comment/feel this way, I come from a privileged position and I acknowledge that and am super grateful and fortunate. I am a currently 21 year old Singaporean who is still studying, lives with her parents and is overall not very affected by this restriction. I do work to pay off my school fees but I’ve worked so hard pre covid and am currently in a position where if I take a break off work for a month, I will be completely fine. My part time jobs are so physically exhausting that circuit breaker and the heightened alert phase have really helped me with just slowing down and taking a breathe. As soon as the first HA was over, I was back to my hustling life juggling working 5-6 day weeks while still attending classes and having a semi social life with friends and family. I am a part time sports/fitness instructor so my jobs deals with interacting with many people throughout the day. This is not easy as I’m an introvert and it drains so much of my social battery. This HA is gonna help again as I’m finally able to take a breathe and slow down again. Again, I know I’m in a super privileged position to say this. My parents don’t need me or my brother me to support the house, we get along just fine with them working from home and I personally workout just fine without the gym, I don’t like being in places that are crowded with people and always preferred to takeout then to eat out so again, I understand my privileged."

5948,h5vujes,"&gt;But srsly what’s the point of an authoritarian government like ours if they aren’t willing to use the stick when necessary? I mean, France of all places is doing it.

Our government is losing power every election. Using the stick likely isn't going to sit well for some ppl, which in turn means losing votes. Whether or not that is the reason, I don't know, but it's a possibility"
5950,h5vvenx,Hmm what about it? Do you see it as a pointless endeavour?
5951,h5vvqf0,No it's 1000 beds reserved for covid. There is still capacity for other needs.
5952,h5vvuco,"&gt;I thot S'pore was well vaccinated

It is decent and improving. More than half of the country isn't fully vaccinated though so that might be an issue. Delta variant is also more transmissible compared to the original. In addition, being vaccinated doesn't mean that you're never getting Covid, it reduces the chances and severe symptoms."
5953,h5vw8vt,We signed the rental agreement last year when it was going at a discount. We are still paying that amount. So I guess it's a decent situation.

5956,h5vxdl0,Care to elaborate the Sinovac idiot part?

You think anyone in the SAF whining about not being able to setiyah on national television matters? Half the involved personnel (if not more) are going to breathe a sigh of relief, the other half will suck thumb because that's what civil and uniformed services do.

There really aren't that many Singaporeans who demand for NDP to happen. The half a dozen that care really don't matter in the grand scheme of things anyway. 

Even your usual die-hard boomer NDP fan who takes their family to the show every year probably wouldn't put up too much resistance if Gov made it clear that this isn't a show of weakness but a deliberate act of unity."

Big parade celebrating something only a few people really care about, while ignoring the big fire burning in the background. So yeah you're right, it is indeed symbolic, but in all the wrong ways.

It'd be a different story if say, anyone at all gave a shit about NDP. But this isn't the 4th of July, or singing Christmas carols while dug into the trenches at the Somme as artillery dropped all around you. This is just some stupid parade that people are mildly entertained by at best."

6026,h5wa1yj,"Answer is yes. After September we should keep 1000 ICU beds for Covid, but not allow under any circumstances for Covid patients to spillover into other healthcare resources. If un-vaccinated seniors find themselves being triaged, then so be it."

6028,h5waf0a,"You're a fucking joke that's what you are. It has been proven on every level that VACCINATION REDUCES TRANSMISSION, SYMPTOMS AND DEATH. You may have a higher threshold for restrictions but I am getting sick of sacrificing my youth for people who don't even care about fulfilling their personal responsibility of getting vaccinated to protect both themselves and others. You have zero empathy and understanding for others, and it is people like you that the government has to constantly placate by targeting zero covid"

Do we just drop the vaccine message and pile on with slaps of restrictions and steps back that we already cannot afford?

6047,h5wdmji,The flu also got people die from it but we simply dont need to lockdown or restrict people from doing certain things because some people die from the flu. Of course when everyone is vaccinated there will still be deaths but its going to be such a negligible amount it doesnt matter. Also old people with high risk of dying from covid were given 6 fucking months or so to vaccinate liao so if they die die still dont want to vaccinate then they can accept the consequences of getting covid.

Also, there're still people that aren't vaccinated yet or can't ever be vaccinated due to medical reasons, so they are still at risk.

Do you get it now you fucking moronic piece of shit?"
6050,h5wedi6,"Reduces, not zero. There are people who can't be vaccinated. Zero covid is ideal, due to the fact that it fucking mutates rapidly.

6066,h5wrf3h,"The comment you replied to is '_fully_ vaccinated by end of September'. You need 3-4 weeks to get the second jab, then another 2 weeks after the second jab to be considered fully vaccinated. So the person you replied to probably mean to get people vaccinated by this week to get fully vaccinated by end Sep. Unless you mean '_first_ jab by this week', then you're just repeating the same thing.

Just bugged me because if you really had meant _fully vaccinated by this week_, it's really your privilege by being Singaporean. &lt;39 PRs &amp; LT pass holders had no choice but to wait for the last batch to open (only from July 2), meaning they'd only be fully vaccinated by end of Aug, die die wanna earlier also cannot."

6070,h5wxh6z,"This is the kind of shitty planning and pussyfooting you’d expect from a secondary school student planned camp, not from a multi-ministry task force spearheaded by the country’s leaders-in-waiting.

I would like to believe that between an authoritative style of governance, a highly educated populace and a world class medical infrastructure, Singapore should be poised to tackle a pandemic effectively. And yet somehow for every success that we’ve had theres 2 or 3 colossal failures in how we’ve handled covid.

Theres no exit plan or roadmap to incentivise vaccine take up, constant pandering to a subset of the population that have been vaccine resistant, and the most ridiculous oversights possible (overly lax immigration control, KTV/nightlife situation that has literally just played out in taiwan). The worst part is the continual punishment of the large portion of the populace that have been accommodating and accepting of covid measures and an refusal to use neither carrot or stick to boost vaccination take up rates amongst the unwilling (those that are unable to due to medical reasons are obviously not within this group). And i find it ridiculous that the government does not realise our recent return to HA just sends a confirmation to the vaccine hesitant that there is absolutely no reason to get vaccinated (vaccinated or not, you still get fked so whats the point).

At the end of the day, what we have are a bunch of very capable administrators that are absolutely unsuited to leading/navigating a country through a crisis. There are no leaders in this “4G” of ours, they are lacking in charisma, foresight, communication skills and a dozen other adjectives. I fully agree that no human is perfect, but the whole point of a government/taskforce is to reduce potential oversight and flaws in the individual by complimenting it with the strength of others. This is absolutely the result of a government full of yesmen and yeswomen from the same party thinking along the same party line."

Millions are not isolating at all, the NHS is coping fine and the economy is booming, they’re literally talking about increasing interest rates as the growth is so high. The virus is never going to go away and people need to have some responsibility for their own actions. I’m double vaccinated as is everyone I know here bar those who choose not to.

6091,h5xf94n,"Isn't there a break in the logic you've used in order to reach the conclusion you've made? You say that the freedom to not be vaccinated for the French is analogous to American's 1st Amendment. You also reiterate that the French government has decided their decision to require the vaccination trumps, in administration's view, the freedom to not vaccinate.

Now, asking Americans to surrender their 1st Amendment right would be considered tyrannical. The point of the 1st Amendment, and the nine Amendments that follow is that the government *cannot* supersede that right, else it is self evident the government is tyrannical in nature. So, with that line of rational stated it also follows that what the French government is enacting is tyrannical. Now, mind you I'm not arguing that vaccination -- forced such as China, or heavily levied such as France -- isn't effective, but it's not disputable the way you've presented the situation that this is an example of a government extending its reach too far, and enacting tyrannical laws for the ""good of the people"" which is so easily abused."
6092,h5xg18r,Sinovac numbers is negligible in the grand scale of our vaccination efforts so far
6093,h5xibud,"It was announced on July 12, not June 21.

Vaccination being higher in Singapore means Macron’s decision was the right one since vaccination was slowing down. Numbers show he was right since we’ve been breaking daily vaccination records each of the past 7 days.

French cases are rising because everything is open again, including nightclubs, hospitalizations are flat, deaths are decreasing."
6094,h5xjo6o,NDP is also not necessary and is a waste of public funds. Can use that to make more people vaccinate.
6096,h5xjpem,"yup, we have 1 ICU covid case n they're locking down the entire country. How is that going towards endemic covid? I dont trust what they say already"

There are a lot of comments here about dragging our elders to get vaccinated. However, we all have to pass on at some point and people should be allowed to make personal choices with associated risks.  As long as there is a clear timeline to removing restrictions, that seems most fair."
6108,h5xofiy,Same except I’ve been lucky enough to to continue “working from home” in the States

6119,h5xras8,"Well do you still want to risk their lives by packing them in a large group? How about the performers? The NSF, the volunteers? Dont forget the outside area where ANYONE can gather regardless of vaccination status. The bridge area, the marina bay sands, gardens by the bay confirm to have people gathering and those place will not be regulated by safe distancing measures"
6120,h5xrf9e,It’s the vote. We are a gerontocracy.
6121,h5xrzt2,They’ve already put lives of many millennials on hold with sky high property prices and policies that mandate against singles from buying hdbs. Boomers are selfish because they can be as they’re the largest demographic and govts around the world cater to their votes.
6122,h5xs2fn,Yes and no. I am currently in university and my parents have told me that they’ll not be paying for my university tuition fees so I just have to work. I honestly do love my jobs and couldn’t have be more lucky to end up with these jobs but it’s gets really tiring to juggled that and school and everything else. I’m not guilty for feeling this way because I have busted my ass working so much pre covid and have saved quite a bit to tide me over.
6124,h5xsqvi,Can't they book their own appointments with MOH or are NSFs not allowed to?
6125,h5xsstx,"I do have to add in the comments that though this is my opinion, I do not wish for this reality on any or everyone. This is just a very very individualistic and selfish view of mine."
6126,h5xsx3w,"Clearly you have no understanding of how mRNA vaccines work and why they are still effective against mutations. And yes, being vaccinated doesn't mean I won't get it, as with any vaccine that has ever been made. Doesn't mean you walk around in fear of measles and rubella and hepatitis, yes? Have you even taken your flu shot this year? Why do you think we have to take the flu shot every single year, and not just once in our lives?

How will I spread the virus to an unvaccinated person unless said unvaccinated person is roaming about outside for no reason (i.e. not fulfilling their own social responsibility to stay home since they are unvaccinated)?"
6127,h5xtcfp,It’s unpopular but it’s still my opinion. It may not be agreeable with the majority but I do indeed feel this way. The CB and HA so far has been super super terrible and affected so many individuals in the worst ways possible and it breaks my heart to see that but there were a few groups of people that carried on with their lives just fine.
6128,h5xtepf,"Rental wasn't the main issue, just a lack of business. For a new f&amp;b outlet that hadn't established a customer base and a reputation for themselves, pivoting to delivery and takeaway is challenging."

6131,h5xvo44,"Think a big problem here is that the PAP has an iron grip on when to call an election that best suits them. This is on top of all the favorable districting and election rules that they set.

Ay before u say KTV illegal, patrons hide their tracetogether. Ok but how about every other single case out there. How effective is this broken ass tech lmao"
6135,h5xw7mx,FB is where brains go to die hahaha
6136,h5xwivk,"Again, they reduce the severity if the symptoms, even if it's mutated. But it DOESNT prevent transmission. Also, nations are already reporting on decreased efficacy of the vaccines when it comes to the variant strains. The diseases you mention are 1) rare (cuz of vaccinations), 2) not easily transmissible (or at least not as easy as how covid spread).

And wow. Just wow. Fyi the vaccination program has not been rolled out to all sections of the public. There's also people with various medical reasons who can't take the vaccines. They too need to work, get food etc. Do I really need to point this out to you?"
6137,h5xwo56,"Also kind of hard to believe that in all of Singapore, only 1,000 ICU beds for Covid? The fuk"

6142,h5xyf3v,"Yes, but that can't happen until everybody who wants their second jab has had the chance to get it. As of now most people at the back of the queue has had only their first dose (including foreigners who only became eligible around 3 weeks ago), and we're still within the waiting period for their second jab.

Once everybody who wants a second jab has had it, then it's time to let 'er rip."
6143,h5xz3bs,Gym is the only stable routine some of us have in these times. Makes no sense to close them completely as there’s been no evidence in SG that they’re hotspots.

6159,h5y6uz0,"The performers and NSFs have all been vaccinated as well. The event is a microcosm of the fully vaccinated society going about their lives as per normal scenario as some commenters are asking for. 

Personally, I don't much care about the parade and whether it continues or not. Though given that you've compared the parade continuing to why dining in isn't allowed anymore, then the vaccinated status matters. It's going to be hard for the average hawker centre or food court to ensure that dine in patrons are vaccinated, while they know for a fact that everyone involved in the parade have had their jabs."

\- 99% -ish of them are asymptomatic / mild, only 1 senior &gt;70 requiring O2

&amp;#x200B;

Whats the big issue then if hardly anyone is sick?

KTV, Fisheries, Markets, and Vaccination status are clearly not the problem - these only serve to divide us.

They are counting on people who can't see this to keep us divided."

(Some) Singaporeans don’t understand how privileged they are, our country has sufficient vaccine supply for everyone and meanwhile, people in other country are dying because of Covid and their inefficient government.

The thing about NDP is that they have already probably spent it, they are ready for the following year’s celebration immediately after they finish the current one. Contracts are already signed, SAF have no choice but to pay these vendors."

6208,h5yui9q,I don’t think there’s a country anywhere on Earth right now where vaccines alone are proving to be enough to keep COVID cases from growing out of control. Iceland is an interesting case in that they reopened travel but I think they haven’t had domestic transmission for a while and they’re basically just waiting for a vaccinated person with a breakthrough case to cause a superspreading event and seed an outbreak.
6209,h5yukbi,"&gt;the more people who are vaccinated, the more this vulnerable group would be protected

Vaccinated people can still spread the virus while they themselves will suffer less of the virus' repercussions. For the vulnerable group to be protected, everyone including babies and young children should also get vaccinated.

6215,h5z0jme,"It absolutely is emotional abuse. Human relations are not transactional; it isn't something like ""they can fend for themselves, so cutting contact with them isn't abuse."" 

Look at it from their perspective. Their loved one; in this case, their child, is cutting them off, refusing to speak to them, and limiting financial support until they do something they don't want to do. Granted, being vaccinated is a good outcome, but you can't try and force them into doing so by threatening not to speak to them."
6216,h5z0u9l,We never needed 1000 ICU beds for Covid. No where close. Most cases don’t require ICU to begin with. We are overly prepared and it’s not a bad thing. It’s bad only when we implement laws which are too disruptive. It suggests indecisiveness.

[https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know)) suggests efficacy rates far lower than mRNA vaccines, to say nothing on the more infectious Delta mutation."
6246,h5ztpgk,"That’s an interesting question, I think the answer is “no,” but I don’t think that by itself necessarily tells us what Singapore should do.

Singapore’s peer countries/regions with regard to COVID is fairly small. This list includes places like Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Macao, Mainland China, and New Zealand (these are the Ministry of Manpower’s low-risk countries if you’re applying for an Employment Pass). I would also add Taiwan in this list but I think there might be some politics going on. These are countries that are currently attempting to maintain zero local domestic transmission of COVID. Multiple parts of Australia are currently under lockdown, as is all of Taiwan, but these places at least have low levels of COVID and are trying to get back to zero.

One thing we’ve seen from how nations have been handling COVID so far is that they’re way more influenced by countries that are geographically nearby or culturally similar. Singapore is surrounded by countries like Malaysia and Indonesia that have had outbreaks for a while (which are now growing), as well as Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, which didn’t have outbreaks until recently but are now being hit by the Delta variant with no end in sight.

I also think the Singaporean government is probably looking very closely right now at Hong Kong, which The Economist says is currently the most normal country/region in the world as a result of its ability to maintain zero COVID:

[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/tracking-the-return-to-normalcy-after-covid-19](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/tracking-the-return-to-normalcy-after-covid-19)

and also at Taiwan, which has been under lockdown since May, but looks likely to return to zero COVID probably sometime in September if current trends continue. And I think Taiwan is going to try to continue on that path looking at what’s goin on in other countries.

If you look farther afield at the US and Europe, these places thought they could keep COVID under control through vaccinations alone, but they were wrong. There are enough unvaccinated people and breakthrough cases (particularly in enclosed environments, e.g. nightclubs) that the virus will continue to pose a challenge for a long long time. The Netherlands backtracked on reopening nightclubs after COVID cases went up 500% in one week:[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/dutch-coronavirus-reproduction-rate-jumps-mostly-young-adults-infected-2021-07-13/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/dutch-coronavirus-reproduction-rate-jumps-mostly-young-adults-infected-2021-07-13/)

The UK just reopened nightclubs a few days ago but I think the smart money says they’re on the same path. Meanwhile in the US, Apple is delaying its return to office:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/apple-reportedly-postpones-return-to-office-until-october.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/apple-reportedly-postpones-return-to-office-until-october.html)

It turns out that “living with COVID” is hard and not fun: people at these companies  who’ve gone back to the office before they were required to keep getting emails that there have been COVID cases in the office, so a lot of people are staying home, which reduces the incentive for other people to go into the office (since they’re going to be on Zoom calls all day anyway), and also public health officials are starting to tell people they still need to wear masks indoors, even if they’re vaccinated. So now people are staying home because they don’t want to wear a mask all day.

If you look at Singapore itself, I think the government would be willing to accept a low level of cases as long as long as it stayed relatively constant, but instead it turned out that even with a relatively restrictive set of rules, cases were still growing exponentially. Note that even with the massive amount of natural immunity places like the US and most European countries have as a result of the massive amounts of illness and death they’ve already experienced, cases are *still* growing exponentially there, which does not bode well for Singapore.

So that’s the set of facts the Singapore government is going off of. They probably realized they made a mistake and that “living with the virus” is going to suck a lot worse than they thought, and would ruin Singapore’s reputation as a well-governed country and make it difficult to attract talent relative to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China.

The question now is if Singapore can actually get back to zero cases, and if it can get there, if it can stay there. But at this point, I think there’s a good case that that’s the best of the possible (bad) options. The only other idea that I think makes any sense would be to basically round everyone up and force them to get vaccinated, and also vaccinate all kids under 12 once a vaccine is approved for them. That might also work, but this remains to be seen. I predict that several US states are going to try to move in this direction sometime in the next few months, and the results of their attempts will be very interesting."
6247,h5zvlvo,Very poor efficacy particularly against delta. Shouldn't be allowed on its own but only alongside Pfizer or Moderna. I'm aware some need Sinovac for travel and I assume some for medical conditions.
6248,h5zwioz,Which vaccine are they administering mainly there?

6253,h5zxnn8,Great. Hope you guys do Ok.
6254,h5zxpkf,Thanks. Hope we can all open up again soon.
6255,h5zylzg,True. It's sad that the kids still have to wait much longer.

You are operating under the false assumption that the rate of spread is the same among vaxxed and unvaxxed people. In reality, vaxxed people can 'kill' the virus before it has a chance to transmit, of even start anything. IIRC, chance of even catching Covid is reduced by ~90% for vaxxed people. 

When you think about it, if what you said is true, we'd be having an outbreak of Super-polio instead of its (near)eradication. Recall that the world carried out a polio vaccination campaign in the past.

6273,h7ngcg0,"&gt; # Visits to all hospital wards to cease for 2 weeks amid rise in COVID-19 community cases: MOH

&gt; SINGAPORE: An interim measure to reduce potential COVID-19 transmission in hospitals will see visits to all wards ceased, with some exceptions, from Aug 5 to Aug 18, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Aug 4).

&gt; This comes after more COVID-19 community cases were detected recently, which include staff members and patients of hospitals, said MOH.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; On Tuesday, MOH reported that Changi General Hospital was among one of eight new clusters in Singapore.

&gt; 

&gt; ""With proactive and regular testing in the hospital, we have detected three cases of COVID-19 in a ward,"" said CGH in a Facebook post.

&gt; ""These cases are not linked to the previous CGH cluster which has been officially closed by Ministry of Health on Jul 31."" That cluster, which had 20 cases, was closed after no cases were linked to it for 28 days.

&gt; On Wednesday, MOH said that new measures will be put in place following a detection of cases.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; ""Any detection of cases within a hospital will invariably lead to a ward closure, limiting movements of patients and staff in and out of the affected ward,"" said the ministry. Affected patients and staff will also be placed on quarantine.

&gt; Such measures while necessary to control further transmission of the virus, will have an adverse impact on hospitals’ capacity in caring for patients by reducing the availability of hospital staff and bed capacities, said MOH.

&gt; As an interim measure to reduce potential transmission in hospitals, visits will stop from Aug 5 to 18.

&gt; This is except for the patient groups below, who will be allowed visitation on a conditional and case-by-case basis, as assessed by the hospital:

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; a. Patients whose conditions have turned very ill;

&gt; b. Paediatric patients;

&gt; c. Birthing/post-partum mothers; and

&gt; d. Patients requiring additional care support from caregivers. For example, assistance of inpatients who have mental incapacities and family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better care for their loved ones after hospital discharge.

&gt; 

&gt; For such patients, only one visitor is allowed per day with visit duration of no more than 30 minutes at the bedside, said MOH.

&gt; For patients who are very ill, up to five pre-designated visitors may be registered, with a maximum of two visitors at the patient’s bedside at any one time of no more than 30 minutes visit duration.

&gt; Any visitor who requires to stay beyond 30 minutes visit duration such as caregiver training, will only be allowed after the visitor test negative on a supervised antigen rapid test, where the validity of the result of this test is 24 hours.

&gt; 

&gt; MOH added that all visitors to the hospitals must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times.

&gt; ""These include reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabrics, and surgical masks.""

&gt; The ministry reminded that there must be no eating or drinking in the inpatient wards, and visitors must not use the patients’ toilets in the wards and must avoid sitting on patients’ beds.

&gt; The ministry said that all patients - inpatient and outpatient - who are unvaccinated will be approached by the hospital healthcare team on COVID-19 vaccination if clinically appropriate.

&gt; Patients who receive their first dose of COVID-19 vaccination at the hospital should return to the same hospital for their second dose, said MOH.

&gt; ""Vaccinated patients will protect other patients in the hospital and reduce the risk of COVID-19 clusters in the hospitals,"" it added.

&gt; 

&gt; MOH said it will review the above measures regularly.

&gt; ""We seek the understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans as we make adjustments to protect our patients and hospitals during this transition period towards a COVID-resilient society.""

6280,h7nk54s,"It's part of the transition to endemic as we will always want to avoid spread in risky environments like hospitals but I wouldn't say that it indicates we will lift broader SMM restrictions in and of itself, I view it more as a direct reaction to the current hospital spreads. Locking down visitors is one way to buy time to implement tighter SOPs like getting unvaccinated patients jabbed and swabbing even more extensively. We aren't going back to the days of single digit community cases any more and the system is clearly not water tight enough with higher levels of virus in the community, even with existing measures like swabbing inpatients on admission and HCW regularly."

With how MOH reports their clusters nowadays, some clusters may not be the hospitals themselves, but people or sectors closely related to them."
6284,h7noaii,I think you misunderstand my point. I'm saying that the temporary lockdown is to buy time to implement improved SOPs that will be necessary to avoid hospital spreads in the new normal with higher community prevalence. I'm not saying the lockdown will be permanent.

6286,h7nq4d3,"I understand you, and we are on the same page (almost!).

I was trying to say that IMO, the main reason for temporary lockdown/restrictions is mainly to curb potential large spread that they suspect.

The healthcare facilities will of course also review their SOPs to find the gaps in their attempts to improve them to stop the spread too. But like you said, the virus (and especially now the delta variant) is extremely hard to contain and measures are never water-tight."
6287,h7nqe4a,"Well, it's just my take because I dunno about large spread apart from expected importation into hospitals from community-acquired infections, although the press release directly says ""to reduce the potential transmission"". Of course measures will never be water tight but with higher community prevalence in the new normal it'll be necessary to deal with the increased occurrences of importation on an ongoing basis, and I just think they are needing to tighten up measures so as to prevent further slips like what just happened.

A prudent Govt would have recognised months ago that its current policies are doing Singapore more long term damage than good. I’ve lived a lot of places and I’ve never seen a country falling apart as quickly as this one is at the moment - so many expats leaving you can’t book a removals company, suicide rates spiking, domestic violence spiking, the closest Singaporeans come to protest with the petition to cancel NDP, international showcase events cancelling, migrant workers throwing themselves off buildings, kids turning up to school with axes and killing each other, not enough quarantine facilities for incoming travelers, hawkers decimated - the list goes on.

6312,hbfk1hk,"&gt; # S'pore to maintain current Covid-19 measures, will rely on vaccination and testing to move ahead

&gt; SINGAPORE - Singapore will stay in the current preparatory stage of its reopening, and will continue to rely on vaccination and testing to keep the Covid-19 situation under control, amid a recent spike in infections. In an update on the Covid-19 situation on Friday (Sept 3), Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, said there were no plans to loosen or tighten curbs at this stage as the country transitions to living with the disease.

&gt; The multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, which he co-chairs, will only tighten measures as a ""last resort"", to keep the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.

&gt; It will also not loosen measures at this juncture, taking into account the time lag between the onset of infections and serious illness, said Mr Wong at a virtual press conference alongside his co-chairs, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.

&gt; Singapore reported 216 new cases of community infections on Friday, with 109 unlinked cases.

&gt; Mr Wong said the recent increase in the number of cases is not unexpected, since more people have been going out following the loosening of restrictions earlier,.

&gt; But Singapore is also in a new phase, with a high level of vaccine coverage, he added.

&gt; As the Government continues to monitor the situation, it will also expand the nation's vaccination and testing regime.

&gt; In view of the more transmissible Delta variant, the Health Ministry (MOH) will start administering booster Covid-19 shots to two groups of people - those who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, as well as those above 60 years and residents of aged care facilities.

&gt; As the first batch of seniors aged above 60 years complete their second doses around March, they will be eligible for the third dose within this month. More details on the implementation of the booster shot will be announced later, MOH said.

&gt; Mr Ong said about 85 per cent of the population would have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by this month.

&gt; Added Mr Wong: ""We have already reached very high levels of vaccination - we are one of the foremost countries in terms of vaccination - we should now aspire to be a nation of testing, where testing becomes a way of life.""

&gt; On the testing front, 20 quick test centres will be set up from Oct 1 to allow people to make an appointment for a self-paid fast and easy test.

&gt; This will supplement regular self-testing, and will enable people to use such tests to fulfil employment requirements, or for an unvaccinated person to attend a mass event.

&gt; Mr Wong said the Government is looking into setting up more of such testing sites across the island, so that it will be easier for people to get themselves tested regularly.

&gt; He added that the Government has already mandated rostered routine testing for people in high-risk settings.

&gt; ""But regular testing should not be confined to those working in such settings,"" he said. ""We want to strongly encourage everyone, whether you're vaccinated or not, to self-test regularly as a matter of social responsibility.""

&gt; That is why the Government decided to distribute antigen test kits to every household, Mr Wong added.

&gt; Mr Ong said personal responsibility and community resilience are ""alternate lines of defence"" to keeping the situation under control, now that the Government is refraining from tightening measures.

&gt; ""I think most of us, all of us, don't want to turn back,"" said Mr Ong. ""Then we must be able to fall back on alternate lines of defence.""

&gt; This includes getting vaccinated, observing safe management measures, wearing masks properly, and not spreading information, among others.

&gt; Mr Ong added: ""This next phase of the journey depends critically on everyone's civic consciousness and social responsibility. So let's take care of ourselves and the people around us.""

This is like your boss saying your promotion and increment after this period and this project. But the goalpost kept changing."

6322,hbfkopc,"Wait…. So the 80% push was for what? Not even back to the same restrictions as phase 3 with **over 80% fully vaccinated.**

I’m beginning to think they might not have a plan after all…."

6324,hbfkrcw,"It may be necessary for just a while more, but I absolutely don’t want testing to be a way of life. Imagine in 2023 if we’d need a negative test to do anything and anytime it’s randomly positive you drop whatever you’re doing and get a mandatory immediate trip to a CCF for a few days. Mass testing of asymptomatic vaccinated people also doesn’t really make sense."
6325,hbfksjj,"Me too. The 80% lead to nothing

Feel like the govt is cheating us over and over again"
6326,hbfksn9,They didn’t move the goal post. The goal post disappeared. Or appeared in other forms.

meanwhile new variants are appearing"
6328,hbfl6yo,"It's 2040, and Singaporeans have achieved 101% vaccination rate, with every man, woman and child going for their daily COVID-19 mRNA booster shots under threat of jail time.

A new batch of adults who are just about to graduate from university have never seen the mouths and noses of their peers, except for nude face photos sent over Snapchat in secrecy.

The government is finally giving more freedom to the population, allowing them to meet up in groups of no more than 6 pax, as long as they've taken their daily vaccine booster shot.

Perhaps, the poor bastards might finally be allowed to travel beyond Germany and Brunei, who are sick of the weird Singaporeans who demand a daily vaccine booster shot.

Hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans ask: ""What the hell is a passport and why do I need it?"""

What are we opening up you ask? We have done well, but there is more we need to do as we transition into a covid resilient nation. There are still many unknowns. We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to. We know it has been a frustrating time for everyone, but we ask for your patience as we do all we can to make sure that Singapore transitions into a covid resilient nation."

6355,hbfqi89,"At this rate we'll just be in this limbo state forever. Because variants will keep appearing and we'll have to fucking wait for new shots for every single one of them

And every time the data will just reset back to 0%

Fuckkkk you guys man seriously"
6356,hbfqslp,"Good that you realise now that they have no plan. They are just following others, like Israel. And now that Israel is getting into deep shit with covid-19, the MMTF can do nothing except to wait for the next “lead country” to emerge and follow them again."

6358,hbfuecp,"Ehhh, i was hoping for a lessening of restrictions, not full reopening. Maybe even 6 pax dining would be nice. We know vaccines won't prevent infection, but if the ICU occupancy rate is low, it means vaccines help reduce the severity of the illness covid inflicts.

At least give a little something to show for the patience of the nation mah"
6359,hbfvogt,"idk about the rest of you but im sure the one thing they really wanted to relax is to have 50% back in office, which has now been achieved

No one likes the fact that we can’t relax measures further and I’m disappointed too, but local cases are rising, there’s a new variant of interest circulating somewhere in the world and it seems from Israel’s case that vaccination is not the perfect answer. It doesn’t surprise me or seem unreasonable for the Govt move the goalposts or change plans or to have uncertainties.

I am just grateful that at least we’ve not been hit with another indoor dining ban, and unlike our migrant worker friends we can head out of our homes whenever we like."
6364,hbfylc9,"100% vaccinated then reset to 0 for 3rd booster shots, lai!

Honestly, alot of these measures seem half-assed. Like writing a thesis paper, cover angles on paper with no idea of how it works out in real life. 

My biggest gripe about the whole situation now? Want to open up and say optional WFH to force everyone to go back to office? Can. But stop the quarantine order and all for close contacts. I’m vaccinated, I’m ok with the Covid risk. I’m not ok with being locked up for 14 days due to being a close contact as a result of the strong pressure to go back to office and all."
6365,hbfz2tc,"So what's the end goal? If we cannot open with the best vaccination rate in the world, despite previous promises from the government who were begging for a strong mandate, then when can we live normal lives?"

6374,hbg1w3v,"I think the ideal end goal would be our pre-pandemic lives without these restrictions or something as close as possible. But is that possible? And if the latter, how much difference and how many or what type of restrictions can we accept? 

I don’t think anyone has a foolproof plan for getting there or knows what sort of “new normal” is feasible. The best that anyone can do is predict and plan based on the best available data which is constantly changing. This is not a factory line or piece of code where we can predict the outcome with some degree of confidence. So I think the only answer - which no one likes - is to expect continued uncertainty. All that aside, not thinking about these uncertainties and focusing on things you can control helps :)"
6375,hbg33ob,"Everywhere. In general, Singapore's government is praised as smart, efficient, honest, and transparent."
6376,hbg3irn,"I saw a lot of things about an 80% vaccination rate target but aside general discussions of how we might open up, I don’t recall a specific measure being tied to that metric. Do you have a source to share if you don’t mind? 

In any case, plans change. It’s hard to fault anyone here. I don’t think anyone expected Delta to be so virulent, or Israel to now experience an uptick in cases. I can understand wanting to be conservative when seeing news and research like this, as much as I still don’t understand some measures like no live music, drinks after 10.30 etc 

Anyway it’s not a bad thing to get vaccinated even if it isn’t tied to a specific opening up measure. At least we can be assured of less severe symptoms if we do get infected and same for our family and friends."

I understand that the situation is evolving but if you make official  statements you should stick to it right? We're in the best position in the world to reopen, supposed to treat covid as endemic, ease measures at 80% vax but nothings happening. Many of my friends only took the vaccine because it was supposed to be a step towards reopening. For me and my friends the risk of covid with and without the vaccine is pretty much negligible, yet we are at the highest risk of complications yet we take it for the goal of reopening.

If we are talking purely the need to test, vaccinated&gt;unvaccinated because the latter will at least show symptoms and go to a doctor, while the former will go around spreading the virus unknowingly"
6401,hbgkp9f,We probably need 200% vaccination to go to endemic /s
6402,hbgmdmx,"While that’s true, as we vaccinate more our priorities and mindset need to shift. The more we vaccinate, the higher the likelihood of asymptomatic transmission, which means that to protect the ever dwindling number of unvaccinated, we’d have to test, trace and quarantine exponentially more. Clearly there’s a divergence - the more our population is protected, the more resources we invest into pandemic management. At some point it is obvious that we shouldn’t be testing tens of thousands of (mostly vaccinated) people every day, but that we should begin to scale down testing and move towards treatment of symptomatic cases instead. ‘Endemic’ and ‘living with the virus’ shouldn’t mean that we test, trace and vaccinate in ever increasing amounts, it means that we can move away from these measures (which were always meant to be temporary)."
6403,hbgogr4,They are a bunch of ball-less fucks. They are being paid to made hard decisions and are now just humming and hawing along. I shudder to imagine if they can react to even tougher crises; for example a Six Day War like scenario where intelligence warns of an impeding invasion and whether they should launch a preemptive strike.
6404,hbgprlr,"Lol how long until we collectively realise that MMTF doesn’t have a concrete plan and end goal in mind? 

Seeing how the goalposts keep shifting, I can’t help but wonder about my annoying 8 y/o nephew who would always ask for my phone so that he can play games. I would always send him to do a task with the promise that he may get to lay his hands on my phone when done. But of course, with phones being a personal extension of ones-self in today’s day and age, I don’t feel particularly comfortable putting myself in a position where someone else, who I deem immature enough, is controlling my phone. It’s always: “Hey, listen to your mother and finish your lunch first” or “Its almost 8pm, take your shower then you can play this”. In the end, he’ll get preoccupied with some other thing and forget/give up on getting my phone.

I have an inkling that this is how our MMTF views us: immature third world citizens who cannot be trusted to their own devices. Big brother MMTF knows best, of course. 

It was never about opening up, we obviously don’t have their blessings. Misleading by claiming that milestones confer privileges is just their version of how I’d dodge handing my phone over to my nephew. It’s seems like that’s what we are after all: just pieces to be moved around."
6405,hbgq1sw,"Yes we can be careful, but there is such a thing as a perfect balance of careful, and we are definitely not in that zone right now. We are absolutely overreacting, anyone can see that. It has got to the point where these restrictions are severely impacting the mental health of many citizens, including myself."
6406,hbgqjzz,"So what's the next step y'all want? 

How we overreacting tho? Think we have a certain level of freedom appropriate for the endemic? Vaccinated still need to be cautious what no meh?

I think we can look at increasing number of ppl gathering at houses tho"
6407,hbgqx1u,Da fk?
6408,hbgrhzz,Middle ground would be going back to phase 3 measures no?
6409,hbgstm1,"This is what you get when you have the PSC scholar scheme, and I can definitely say the type of leaders we’re going to get 20 years from now will be the same."
6410,hbgtuzb,"Their KPI of 80% has been obtained, their plan now is for us to ""deal with it""."
6411,hbgu8xm,LKY would probably reopen like Boris once Singapore hit 80%. He might even get himself infected just to show how soft we Singaporeans have become.
6412,hbgu9nz,It's Neverending
6413,hbguiy3,"Hmm i don't know if it's an unpopular opinion. If they don't want to loosen restriction, they probably shouldn't loosen the borders as well."
6414,hbgw49t,That would literally mean further easing up in the midst of a huge spike in unlinked cases.
6415,hbgxu0a,Honestly people saying 80% led to nothing? Without 80% we would have reverted back to phase 3 by now…
6416,hbh2nfq,So status quo for the most part?
6417,hbh3iyr,"No it wouldn’t. And even if cases do rise, till now long are we gonna wait for us to even get 50% of our life back to normal? Until Covid is completely eradicated in SG? Is that what the gov is waiting for? Coz that will never ever happen. And sad to say, instead of moving forward, I see us moving backwards, and redditors like you will just blindly follow and make excuses for their lack of planning"
6418,hbh4s34,11/10 will agree that’s what happens when you optimize for scoring in tests
6419,hbh53ex,I’m surprised we have no world class soccer team when they so good at magicking goalposts around
6420,hbh7wcg,"lol what lack of planning? Plan for what, opening up while the number of unlinked cases are extremely high? How is maintaining the status quo going backwards? Don't just anyhow complain."

6422,hbh976u,thank you for being at the frontlines
6423,hbhhn28,"Never mind low ICU occupancy rates. No one wants covid to enter their bodies.

In fact, go ask anyone on the street, this question:

""Would you like to be infected with Covid, even though you may be asymptomatic or suffer from mild symptoms?""

My guess is that each and every one of their answers will be a resounding *No*."
6424,hbhi2xs,"Target vaccination rates were never really meaningful to start with when you think how poorly it performs against infection. 

 And then the need for booster shots brings down vac rates after 6 months. The Prime Minister himself had had his second jab in January and is likely unprotected at this stage."

To be fair probably by complete accident, but still"
6426,hbhiy6e,"The UK is a better example, and they removed all restrictions in July. Cases actually fell sharply (probably unrelated) and then stabilized. Hospital admissions stable. Hospital capacity usage stable."
6427,hbhz4tw,"You’re literally the definition of someone who follows something in blind faith. Like a cult. Absolutely ridiculous to even get you to see how bad of a job they are actually doing. 

Secretly I bet you want SG to stay like this forever"
6428,hbi10ld,"Isn't that why we wear masks? Why we took the vaccine? From the way you're speaking, it seems you are extremely keen to pursue the zero covid strategy. Wouldn't this mean Singapore keep up its strict border control and measures? 

No one wants to get covid. We've taken steps and accepted laws &amp; measures to slow its spread. Its not like we're Americans who just want "" muh fruhdom "".

There's got to be a balance. So long as i'm vaccinated, and the science shows that there is no long covid damage inflicted upon me if i'm unlucky enough to get it, then the gov should start planning for less restrictive measures to reopen our borders"
6429,hbifobh,"Hahah this is why I left, this country has covid Stockholm Syndrome. So glad to be in Texas with life back to normal. I have my 2x sinovac and mask up indoors, otherwise everything is normal."

6431,hbifz09,"&gt;Unfortunately singapore is run by boomers and it seems like most boomers are perfectly content with the way things are going. You can see Facebook YouTube comments with boomers clamoring for a lockdown again.

They can lockdown themselves at a nursing home, without the nursing home staff to put up with their crap."
6432,hbiiwgy,We have to pay for the testing too... Like yea makes sense but still.... Idt we gonna gain herd immunity if the rest of the seniors dont vaccinate
6433,hbikcvj,"yeah agree with you. if we really want to treat it like a flu, then we have to look at effective and cheap treatment against covid and not relying on some half f vaccine. 

As a medical hub I really thought we will do better when it comes to producing treatment for viruses like these."
6434,hbipl1u,"Curious to know which restrictions would have biggest impact if lifted? I don’t have family here so dining out limit is not an issue. I miss live music but it’s not making me mentally ill not to have it. 

For me it’s quarantine free travel that is the big one. I also hate masking outdoors although over half of us don’t do that in the parks snd nobody gets fined so I guess that has been lifted in practice."
6435,hbivmji,"""Mass testing of asymptomatic vaccinated people also doesn’t really make sense"".

It makes no sense. And ARTs miss a lot of positives."
6436,hbiwwev,"No. No one likes the fact that they WON'T relax measures further.

6437,hbizprq,"We went from Phase 3 to Phase 2 (HA), so that is the step back we're referring to.

The lack of planning is the transition from Pandemic to Epidemic. Now with 80% of our eligible population vaccinated, what's the plan to enact the transition?"
6438,hbj02tp,Variant Mu is out. Apparently can bypass the immunity from previous infection &amp; also the vaccine defense
6439,hbj31vl,"Sg has always been a data driven place. Now thers no data, what to do? Can't afford to be the data ourselves or the current party will lose if people start dying."

6441,hbj77gj,"I’m very jaded. I’m a frontliner working at one of our big hospitals **cough cough** near Chinatown. I’m not here to comment on the seriousness of the disease or the validly of our current phase of whatever new plan we have. 

Neither am I’m not tin foil hatter. But this is just a broad based common sense statement. When a society relinquishes power through elections and such, not only hard to get it back, but well meaning government forces will think that they have the ultimate responsibility to do whatever it takes to mitigate risk. Ultimately it becomes impossible for them to give back the power given to them. Temporary measures become permanent. Permanent measures become the norm. (Think pre/ post 9/11 and how the world changed re: airport security and widespread phone spying)

Singapore has prospered at a foreign investment level better than nearly every other country during Covid. We’ve got richer as a country and very few people have died in Singapore. At a ground level.. they have converted people like airline staff and DJs into Covid related jobs. These jobs are highly paid (&gt;$20/h). I am of the belief that this is at the cost of people having meaning in their life.

Leveraging this power that the government yields is quite widespread in companies. Ii have a close friend who started a new job recently where they’ve said no one is allowed to travel outside of the country even when travel bubbles open up unless it’s on compassionate grounds. 1 degree relative etc. How can you tell someone who works from home they can’t go somewhere even if they are still working - you can if you are leveraging gov. power. 

That being said our new normal isn’t a totalitarian dystopia. We will continue to live like this because not only is it the government we chose but because there are no alternatives. I am not super pro PAP or opposition they both have their faults.. but unless there is a suitable and worthy challenger nothing will change. The net net outcome however? Largely positive. Will Singapore always be a safe place to live where you can survive till you die - yes. 

I hope that if we go back to some sort of normality before the next election that this whole pandemic isn’t forgotten. Recent bias is a dangerous thing. The structures are in place for any political party to get us through another pandemic. 

I wonder how it will reflect in the 2024 popularity vote."

6459,hbfkhzu,"&gt; # No easing of restrictions for now amid spike in COVID-19 cases: Lawrence Wong

&gt; SINGAPORE: There will be no easing of COVID-19 restrictions for now as authorities monitor the situation amid a spike in local COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 multi-ministry task force co-chair Lawrence Wong said on Friday (Sep 3).

&gt; ""We do not intend to make any new opening moves at this juncture, because there is a time lag between the onset of infections to serious illness, and so we want to take some time to monitor the situation,"" he said.

&gt; ""Also, we have recently announced a whole series of pilots, be it vaccinated travel or allowing our workers in the dormitories to be out in the community. So we want to allow these pilots to continue over the next few days and weeks before we contemplate further moves.""

&gt; His comments came as Singapore reported 216 locally transmitted cases on Friday, as large clusters emerged in bus interchanges and Bugis Junction.

&gt; Ministry of Health director of medical services Kenneth Mak said on Friday that the rise in cases is ""not unexpected"" as Singapore resumes more activities.

&gt; Despite the rise, Associate Professor Mak said there has not been a significant surge in the number of cases that require intensive care, adding that there have been no new admissions to the intensive care unit since Aug 21.

&gt; Mr Wong said there is no need to tighten restrictions as Singapore already has a high level of vaccine coverage and is now starting to live with the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; ""In the past, when we have a situation of such high daily cases, we would have looked to measures like a heightened alert, or even a circuit breaker to control the infection,"" Mr Wong said.

&gt; ""But we are in a new phase, where we have a high level of vaccine coverage to protect Singaporeans, and we are now moving into a phase of living with COVID and becoming COVID-resilient.

&gt; ""And so we assess that there is no need to impose tightened restrictions. In fact, we would only revert to such a tightened posture as a last resort to prevent our hospital system from being overwhelmed.""

&gt; Mr Wong said authorities will continue with aggressive testing and contact tracing to slow down transmission and avoid uncontrollable surges in cases that could easily overwhelm the hospital system.

&gt; The Government is also studying whether to add more quick test centres islandwide to allow people to get tested more easily, he said. Twenty of such centres have already been set up across Singapore.

&gt; Nevertheless, Mr Wong said safe management measures like safe distancing continue to be ""very helpful"" in slowing down virus transmission.

&gt; ""Our enforcement officers continue to be on the ground. They are inspecting different establishments, and they will enforce the rules fairly and firmly,"" he said.

&gt; ""If there are minor offences, they may issue a warning, they may issue a fine. But if there is a major breach, for example, multiple breaches of the one-metre rule at any particular establishment, or they inspect and there are attempts to even block the enforcement officer from doing their jobs, then such a major offence will result in immediate closure of the establishment.""

&gt; Beyond relying on just enforcement, Mr Wong called on the public to exercise social responsibility and comply with the measures.

&gt; ""So with regular testing and effective safe management measures, we can keep things under control and continue on this journey of reopening safely,"" he added.

6475,hbfl1xk,"‘adding that there have been no new admissions to the intensive care unit since Aug 21.’ Two week no increase in ICU, seems like a good metric to base loosening restrictions on. Otherwise what are we scared of?"

At this rate, Australia would have opened things up having hit their targets by the time we even think of opening up."

6511,hbfmjqf,"My father is immunocompromised and left Singapore the day that home quarantine was announced cause he much rather take his chances than being locked at home one more day. He was suffering from depression and is so much better now.  You might have a different risk appetite and are welcome to stay home. 

The US is such a terrible comparison with their lack of health care and obesity epidemic. Look at the UK where only 25 under 18s have died the entire pandemic (half of which had severe health conditions). The vast majority of people are being completely irrational and dismiss the pain that the measures put on people."
6512,hbfmmxw,Almost like woah delaying the inevitable is the point. Remember mild and asymptomatic merely refers to not hospitalized or needing oxygen. Having large swaths of your population with a high fever at once isn’t going to be fun for anyone

6531,hbfn2sa,"I just want them to give a concrete timeline of when they’re gonna review the situation again. In one week’s time? Two weeks? Then just saying “nothing for now, just wait and see” is leaving everyone in an uncertain state of limbo again."

6535,hbfn9p4,You are talking too much sense to a bunch of young people who think they will forever be healthy and invincible. Lol.
6536,hbfn9qt,It does effect people that think they’re fucking ridiculous outside and of no benefit. Let’s ditch things that don’t help (like temperature screening) and keep things that do.

They already do - why not use it for good, for once."

What are we opening up you ask? We have done well, but there is more we need to do as we transition into a covid resilient nation. There are still many unknowns. We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to.

A tiny minority with other health issues will get more severely sick. Some will die. It's inevitable and i don't see the point in this tortoise speed approach."

We have been cooped up in our homes for a year and a half now. That's 2% of your lifetime if you live the average age, spent in circumstances that take away the freedoms and joys that you live for. And if you're like me and most others here, it is a year and a half of the best years of your life. 

Do you ever want to go back to life as normal? Then pick up that fucking bar."
6588,hbfp1ha,"Govt have no Iron to fix what they want to do but to keep shifting goal post as and when needed. They don have the ""Yolo"" mindset to either continue lockdown to curb unlink case or go full open up (less mask off, this i agree we still need to be on mask till this shit show is over)"
6589,hbfp34k,Most ppl IRL don't share the view of mass reopening given what's going on.

6592,hbfp77s,Yes my bar is low for them. That's why I have consistently voted for opposition in every election.
6593,hbfp8ds,"Yes, the majority is stupid and you're just exceptionally enlightened. Everyone is consciously making decisions that are bad for them and you are the only one clairvoyant enough to see that. Happy?"
6594,hbfp8kq,"I’m sure restrictions will be eased when vaccination rate is higher than 100%, don’t worry 🤡"
6595,hbfpfi5,Pushing an agenda that works rather than the piss poor risk free rubbish we have been served up.
6596,hbfpjxq,"Well, I just went out ytsd. Shopping malls are fucking crowded, trains are fucking crowded. And all this happen in a  mid afternoon of a work day. Doesn't seem like they want restrictions too"
6597,hbfpkgm,"I'd expected that to happen was wondering why they were taking this long to announce the next stage. 

I think it's the wrong move. We're moving into endemic move this sends the wrong signal. I understand why they delayed it, they should at least announce the next set of reopening and will be implemented once the cases come down. They need to get people accustomed to higher number of cases"
6598,hbfpkl6,"No they are not. They are concerned about losing votes from the “conservative”/kiasi population who will blame them for opening up when cases are high. They want to open up and they know that SG can accept a much higher case load, but if they do so now, it looks really tone deaf.

The best they can do is hold steady. I mean, there are plenty of people asking for tightening up!

Gotta wait for a bit of a dip before they can loosen again. Or at least stay at ~200 but number in ICU stays below 10 or so."
6599,hbfpsny,This bodes very poorly for how we intend to handle any future post-COVID pandemic (especially considering that COVID's greatest threat was its transmissibility moreso than its lethality).
6600,hbfptp0,"Well, I just went out ytsd. Shopping malls are fucking crowded, trains are fucking crowded. And all this happen in a  mid afternoon of a work day. Doesn't seem like they are very very risk averse"
6601,hbfpuyc,"Whatever works just happens to be conveniently what you want. Never mind Israel schools reverting back to remote learning again, reverting back their mask mandate and their quarantine mandate, oh no!"
6602,hbfq0qx,"How about the people who are unemployed or falling into depression, they don't matter?"
6603,hbfq22z,"Heck, it probably bodes very poorly for how they intend for people (particularly young people) to take the booster jab(s). Now that they realize getting jabbed = opening up doesnt go according to even the vague timeline given, why take the booster jab(s)?"
6604,hbfq27d,I’m sure the MMTF think they’re doing a hell of a job themselves. One worthy of the salary.

6606,hbfq2xb,"You don't get it, they will not drop until everyone has had covid. Delta is too contagious."
6607,hbfq68v,"How about people that are falling into depression because of the stress the recent case explosion has caused? Do they matter?

See I can make up hypotheticals to support my agenda too"
6608,hbfq818,"I'm outside every single day, I worked from a cafe today for e.g. it can mean you're okay with the status quo and don't want further tightening but also don't want further loosening of restrictions.

6609,hbfqagf,"Well please sir, why don't you offer a strategy? Even if it's *stay like this forever"" just tell me what you would do."
6610,hbfqbc1,UK hospitalizations have risen recently again. Will probably drop back sooner or later though
6611,hbfqduv,"It's not hypothetical, i told you of my father who aged 10 years since travel was banned. Suicides are up 50%. I know plenty of people who are earning a lot less than before."
6612,hbfqf1d,"Weird, because they have been dropping until the recent rise."
6613,hbfqfwj,"The cases spiked this week, should see if this spike results in icu cases, if not, then you know vaccines are working.

For now we just know that vaccines aren't that great in terms of preventing outbreaks. Shortly we'll know to what extent they previous very severe cases."
6614,hbfqj57,"It’s 5 million people in a very small place so underwater would be crowded also. Remember it’s zero travel and people having to clear annual leave. 

The ruling party returns to the voters every few years so they are fully aware of the political price of getting it wrong. Nobody needs to remind them that they need to get the ground sentiment spot on."
6615,hbfqjm1,Bye!
6616,hbfqjsr,"They have rise since we opened fro HA, you wanna go back to that? It didn't read it it. Again, all int asking is for a plan but you don't have one."
6617,hbfqlc1,"Haiz. Not that I am going traveling anytime soon but even my company strictly mandate that no employee is able to travel overseas now except for compassionate reason.

I don't know when companies start to do this kind of ordering to employees."
6618,hbfqli1,"&gt; maybe they are waiting for jabs to be approved for under 12s

I don't see how that is going to make a meaningful difference to the current situation."
6619,hbfqn8g,You’re not cooped up in your home and you can still go outside.
6620,hbfqrpd,"Nah. If Singaporeans are ""very very risk adverse"" as you claimed,  they will br staying home or shopping malls will be empty like Bugis Junction."
6621,hbfquua,"Anecdotal “evidence” are just as useless as hypotheticals. My mother has been very stressed for me and herself due to the recent surge. Suicides rose due to the harsh lockdown last year, and lmao if you call this a lockdown. I also know plenty of people earning more than before or gained a job due to the pandemic. 

Like, see how useless this is?"
6622,hbfqxx8,"Sorry I am wrong and that you are smarter than the government. Please run for PM, if you can read the ground sentiment so well. Thanks!

Remember, it’s quite easy to start a political party. You can call your party “freedom party” or whatever. Look forward to you forming the next government!"
6623,hbfr189,"Me neither, but what else is there that links to possible relaxing of measures? Once we meet the 3rd  booster jab goalpost, whats stopping them from requiring us to get the 4th, 5th, 6th? That path leads to an endless loop. Nothing makes sense anymore."
6624,hbfr38q,"Hmm, I would be crucified here if I said yes, so I guess no. 

I already told you my plan. Open up when case drops. And no, it doesn’t take infecting everyone, that’s stupid. The UK cases dropped without everyone being infected"
6625,hbfr74n,"Just like to point out that there are hundreds of thousands of people who might not want further reopening and hundreds of thousands of people that want to reopen. It only takes a small fraction of the latter group to crowd the trains and malls, doesn’t mean that the former group doesn’t exist."
6626,hbfrdjy,what you want
6627,hbfrfd3,We decided to stay in lockdown for ever.
6628,hbfrg6q,Indeed - I think they’re overreacting too.
6629,hbfrkaq," PM Lee is sending out the right message, '' We will get covid at some point"" while the fools under him is still trying to achieve covid zero"
6630,hbfro30,If only we had fucking mountains of data from other countries that could give us that info.
6631,hbfru4l,"Yes, they exist. And they can stay at home themselves. If we open up, are we forcing them to go out? No. 

So why are they forcing restrictions on others?"
6632,hbfrzv6,"I honestly can't take it anymore. It was 60% partial jab, then 60% fully jab, now is 80% fully jab and we're still living as if a vaccine doesn't exist... help..."
6633,hbfs089,Same. Cockup got money got AL also can't go overseas
6634,hbfs0tz,"Dam, bruh, you should be their speech writer. I totally read that in LW voice"
6635,hbfsc0r,"In govt's word ""if its not because we are at 80%, we will already be on circuit breaker again"""
6636,hbfsiix,"Which country have high vaccination rate, on a similar climate, with similar density and movement as Singapore? You want to use Indonesian data? Or Malaysian?"
6637,hbfsjaj,"It is mentioned in the article that one reason why they're not loosening restrictions, is because they're piloting a few programmes and would like to see how these go - including allowing migrant workers back into the community.

If that is a major reason, then I'm fine with not loosening restrictions for now. The migrant workers have suffered enough. If we have to put up with a lack of easing for now just so they can be allowed back, this is acceptable to me."
6638,hbfsmqn,Nice! Where you going?
6639,hbfsmrn,"We already know that. We had a spike in cases two months back that lead us to a semi-lockdown. Result? Max 40 people ""severily ill"", max 8 people in ICU (out of 1000 available) and 16 deaths (just one vaccinated)

So? Is it not enough proof? And back then vaccination rates were lower. Back then the lockdown excuse was ""give us 4 weeks"". Now we have 80% of people fully vaccinated. What are we waiting for?"
6640,hbfsnf8,Might be difficult to get a 5 year visa.
6641,hbfsr1s,"Australia is probably going to behave like Western Europe: lift pretty much all except for indoor masks once they hit a target vaccination rate. 

This is good, it’ll force SG to follow at some point..."
6642,hbfsrjd,"This is the first time I regretted that I started business in Singapore and not elsewhere.

I’m quite sure many likeminded people will either leave or not come at all.

Despite many saying that “then this is not a good country for you”, I believe this might have a huge long-term impact. I saw it in my home country how incompetent government destroyed the growth, will not be surprised to see it here too."
6643,hbfsss7,"Mask does really help though. Our current condition happens even when all of us are masked. The bus interchange in particular is very airy. Also notice while Singapore have enforced mask order, its still not as extreme as Australia's."
6644,hbfsvgh,Eh 1G forward thinking means still got progress leh 🤨🤔
6645,hbft5wg,I don’t think they know their metric either. Make it up as they go along
6646,hbft8ok,"A calibrated plan towards normalcy. And sticking to the plan.

If COVID really is endemic, all 5M+ of us here will get infected at some point. If 200 cases are going to stop us from lifting things like dining in from 5 to 8, then we are going to be living under restrictions for the rest of our lives."
6647,hbftax7,Denmark!
6648,hbftfg8,"If you get sick of Covid-19, and got scared that it will get worse around the end or in the middle, will you feel more assured if you are warded or when you are told ""please stay at home""? The treatment are both free (mostly). 

Covid-19 is not flu. That's the entire point of the vaccine and entirety of last year."
6649,hbfth15,"This is a real question that they need to answer. If we are not lifting restrictions when 90% of the population aged 12+ is vaccinated, what’s the plan? What’s the end game? Stuck forever in restrictions?"
6650,hbfti9z,Amazingly it’s on both sides. There will be those that deem them incompetent cos ‘cAsEs aRe OUtTA CoNtRol’ and others because they have continued to impose heavy restrictions while having one of the highest vax rates in the world.
6651,hbftpci,Fear is control. No government can resist the temptation of grabbing more power through fear. History has shown us that it keeps happening a lot. Why else would they push TT?
6652,hbftqb5,BRB going to jail for leaking state secrets
6653,hbftyy9,Minister calibre *claps*
6654,hbfu2sr,"People have differing priorities. 

Many of the people who want to be more conservative with reopening have young children. While they are less susceptible by far, your tolerance of risk is always a bit lower when it comes to your children, and the long term effects of covid on unvaccinated children aren't very well known yet. In addition, the delta variant seems to be more severe among young children (severe cases are still rare, but less rare). 

In addition, I know of people over the age of 55 who want to be more careful too. Those that I know are vaccinated, but they're older than typical reddit folk and are more cognisant of their mortality. They know that even though they're vaccinated, a good portion of people get rather seriously ill; since they are older and less healthy, the odds are less good for them than statistics suggest. 1% chance of serious illness is a population average. The thing about serious illness is that you don't have to die to have your quality of life severely impacted. This is especially true for older people who can't bounce back as easily. We all know of older folk who just got one serious illness and their health just enters a downwards spiral and they're stuck with no quality of life at all. 

What do these people want? I doubt most want a forever lockdown till we have new vaccines, just the cautious reopening that Singapore has basically been doing (or maybe even more cautious). They want things to stabilise at a certain risk level, and to know what risk level that is and whether it is acceptable, before taking another opening up step, which is exactly what is happening now. The PAP isn't stupid and knows their voter base. 

Personally, I work overseas, and I haven't seen my family for a while because I don't get breaks long enough to brave the SHN and have any more time to spend. I want full reopening. You know those people who have been stuck without seeing their family for almost 2 years because of covid? Yeah, that's me. Doesn't hurt to step in someone else's shoes and have a bit of empathy though."
6655,hbfubgn,"UK cases totally dropped when a very large portion of the population got infected. What else do you think made their cases drop? 

In Singapore we get 200 positives from random testing. If you don't do random testing and 98.5% of infected have no to mild symptoms and don't go for testing eventually cases will drop cause everyone has been exposed to the virus."
6656,hbfug5u,Absolutely ridiculous rules if I’m honest
6657,hbfuhuk,Enjoy!
6658,hbfuo3j,"With the need for the booster, I think they’ll conveniently reset it to 0%. Let’s start this “work towards 75%” bullshit again 👏🏼"
6659,hbfur2v,"I'm in your same shoes man. Looking forward to travelling over Christmas and then doing SHN at home. 

Honestly, i think for children the lack of exposure to viruses in this distanced and masked world is far more dangerous than covid. They are supposed to be building their immune system and we lock them away. Not to talk about the mental impact. 

Similar for old people. Most of them want to enjoy their twilight years and not being told they can't have coffee or play mahjong with their friends. 

And let's not get started on the people who are suffering from depression or lost their source of income due to the restrictions. Somehow their lives matter less than those who are afraid but not at risk of covid. 

And finally, the government hasn't been honest, cause this slow reopening has no end game. Are they going to stretch it out over 2 years?"
6660,hbfura4,Another 4 more years.
6661,hbfuwuk,I said earlier I would bet $100 on the delaying of restrictions and that's exactly what happened. The cowards that make the MMTF are so easy to predict now
6662,hbfv1we,"I left in June after they locked down for 9 community cases despite 50% vaccination at the time. I lived in SG for 5 years, too"
6663,hbfv4l0,"Lol if you’ve “consistently voted for opposition in every election”, nothing they do will ever please you. It’s not about the pandemic, if you were unhappy with their policies even before the pandemic."
6664,hbfv9wb,"To be clear, you don’t mean world’s vaccination rate right?"
6665,hbfvcjh,"No jail lah, give you ""bonus"""
6666,hbfveng,"Very nice to see goalposts shift to very large from all. Vaccination is more or less equivalent or better than getting infected when it comes to COVID protection, so we already have “large portion infected”. As for what made their cases drop, surely you remember their astrazenca vaccine drive? That’s it working 

And it doesn’t matter how much they test less than us. Trends should still apply.

Can’t believe you’re unironically advocating for the trump strategy of no testing though"
6667,hbfvfa9,Visa run then haha
6668,hbfvhxy,Fucking hate this country
6669,hbfvi1f,How does it help? Do you know how people caught it? Do you know if they were wearing it properly? Do you have anything to back up the idea that this is beneficial?
6670,hbfvo07,Yeah!! Staycay!
6671,hbfvz0k,"They probably think they're pleasing both sides. Boomers want lockdown, Zoomers want reopening, so they think perfect middle ground is do nothing lor. End up I think now both sides pissed off."
6672,hbfvzk1,I remember hotel is quarantine order.
6673,hbfw1av,yeah! I’m also 100% ok with current restrictions until migrant workers in dorms are allowed out!! kudos to you!
6674,hbfw2jh,"Just curious, is any other Asian country doing it better in your opinion? Remember that if you don’t set up shop in Asia, you’re missing out on all the sweet economic growth in the region."
6675,hbfw7d7,So they meant 80% booster shots rate maybe.
6676,hbfwb3c,Everything changed once we got the vaccines
6677,hbfwbm0,The elephant in the room
6678,hbfwcql,"In that case no data can be used between two countries in the world already.

Literally try name 2 country that have same vaccination rate, similar climate, similar density and movement. Go ahead."
6679,hbfwex7,"What incompetence? If they were to be seen opening up in the midst of rising covid-19 cases, the people scared of covid-19 will be calling them out of touch with reality and demanding for their heads. There is literally no pleasing everyone."

6681,hbfwo5l,civil service?

6684,hbfx4lx,"Actually, our government has been pretty competent in regards to covid related issues as well as the development of the country as a whole (big picture, smaller details some minor fk ups but which country doesnt have minor fk ups). Cant find any other country in our region that has tackled this pandemic as well as our governement. 

Not trying to invalidate your opinions as a start up owner, but maybe try relooking into your business models and adapt, its really on you for not doing market research if your products and services are not well recieved here (pricing, product relevancy, product quality and/or needs of local people and economy). Because imo, if a business cant be adaptable, theres a huge possibility that its going to be irrelevant in the near future, times change fast. And especially in a time where a bigger group of people are looking closer at their financials. 

Also, accounting into benefits by the government, low tax rates. Biggest downside is cost of property and rental."
6685,hbfx4mz,I've heard from my friend whose family member was positive but no symptoms. He stayed in hotel.
6686,hbfxa3f,That’s from Aug onwards or before Aug?
6687,hbfxaer,Uh... Did u miss the comment I replied to u in another thread where I praised PM Lee? Lol. I am not stingy with my praise 😁
6688,hbfxf5k,"Well yes. Each countries take its own measures and approach to the pandemic. That's the point

Even if you want to use countries like Canada or Australia which is same Commonwealth to refer to their plan, their density and country makeup are different. 

Or if you want to use places like Hong Kong that is similar business centre and have high chinese ethic population, Hong Kong is currently using different strategy compared to Singapore so Singapore cannot refer to it. Tokyo as a city is still in middle of ""emergency"". 

The only thing govt can learn, is that re-introducing restriction is bad, and nobody wants to turn away patients. Or are you thinking that ""we bought all those ICU beds and general wards. Its not full yet. We must use all of them""."
6689,hbfxksp,This was sometime in July if I rmb correctly.
6690,hbfxol9,Guess that’s the testing phase for certain folks
6691,hbfxqap,"&gt; Honestly, i think for children the lack of exposure to viruses in this distanced and masked world is far more dangerous than covid. They are supposed to be building their immune system and we lock them away. Not to talk about the mental impact.

There's a reason we use vaccines instead of chickenpox parties now. Vaccines don't come with shingles later in life. More broadly, even mild diseases carry risks and long term effects, so very few parents actually try to get their children sick, and I am highly doubtful that it's good for them. 

There's a different issue with the microbiome but a healthy microbiome doesn't involve respiratory viruses at all, so while it is true that giving children exposure to diverse sources of microbes might help (science is not entirely solved yet), it's mostly environmental microbes. Masks don't affect that. 

&gt; Similar for old people. Most of them want to enjoy their twilight years and not being told they can't have coffee or play mahjong with their friends.  

The older folk I've spoken to simply don't agree with that. I suspect you are speaking for people that you can't speak for. Most of them? That's a bold statement to make without a randomised and properly weighted sample.

&gt; And finally, the government hasn't been honest, cause this slow reopening has no end game. Are they going to stretch it out over 2 years?

Obviously no. The government is trying to balance everyone's concerns by one of the only covid zero countries to actually be moving away from that (Australia just started, but unlike Singapore they were forced by their lockdown not working). This _is_ the middle ground; if the more cautious among us had their way we'd be New Zealand.

&gt; And finally, the government hasn't been honest, cause this slow reopening has no end game. Are they going to stretch it out over 2 years?

There's no end game because no one knows what the future has in store. Reality doesn't always cooperate. You try to reopen slowly and carefully, and if it doesn't work out and things seem to be dragging out for too long, you'd have to re-evaluate the level of risk that you're willing to take.

I reside in a region which had a nice covid reopening plan. Everything was great and dandy, and boom, hospitals are filled and elective procedures are postponed again. Everyone on this sub reddit seems to think that having a published plan is strictly a good thing. Well, it is if you're young and healthy and just want reopening, but it also means the government has to stick to the plan because of the political cost of changing it. There would be no ability to respond to unforseen circumstances. Sure, young and healthy people might not care, but many others do.

The region I work in had a reopening plan. Hospitals are full, and elective surgeries are being postponed. A plan didn't prevent things from going wrong when the Delta variant emerged, it merely prevented the government from responding to Delta without worrying aboutthe political cost."

6701,hbfyns4,"I opened my business 3 weeks before the first lockdown last year, it took me around 14 months to prepare, so it’s not about market research. And it’s not about the business model or adaptation, it’s simply about if people go out or not. 

If the media spends few weeks to discuss a cluster in a shopping mall that in fact has zero relevance because of most cases being asymptomatic, and then it impacts the footfall multiple times, it’s about how the whole pandemic is positioned by the government. 

I have no complaints about how this was managed before the vaccination rates reached what they reached now, I literally meant that this is first time I regret choosing SG over another developed market. Not talking about regional neighbors as it was never an option."

Looking at the comments here, this subreddit is just an echo chamber mainly populated by anti-restriction people and angry *anti-lockdown* foreigners (some of whom are thinking of leaving or already left Singapore). The government has to represent the entire population (the anti-restriction people and pro-restriction people) and cannot satisfy everyone at the end of the day"
6708,hbfz80y,"Yet it doesn’t actually prevent people catching Covid, otherwise these clusters wouldn’t pop up. The last list of articles I’ve seen on here seem to indicate it stops droplets spreading in lab settings but has no or minimal benefit in real world studies (I.e, our bus interchange).

In this car-lite country, public transport is absolutely essential for life in the country to run smoothly. Isolation of more bus captains will impact service reliability, which may mean you can't get on the buses at all and WFH as a result, or even HBL.

My deal breaker with PAP is their continuous lack of disrespect towards democracy and suing citizens. Sorry, I just don't like leaders who sue their citizens over random Internet postings.

6763,hbg547i,"It's the US, [by end 2020 alone about 1/3 of Americans have had covid-19](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/926424). While the vaccination rate is 50%, it is likely that by this point natural immunity rates are also ~50% since it's not like covid-19 stopped spreading in the US in Dec; this naively combines to be equivalent to ~75% vaccinated. It is not clear whether that number is an over or underestimate since natural immunity combined with vaccination strengthens immunity even further than just the vaccine, however natural immunity on its own is weaker.

In addition, there are no big cities where I live. With significant differences in mask wearing, population density, other non-pharmaceutical interventions, and family and social structures with all the comparison points Singapore has, in addition to different vaccination rates, it's really not clear what would happen if Singapore reopened completely right now with the negligible levels of natural immunity. I don't think it's clear cut that everything would be just fine. The countries that are reopening with only small increases in hospitalisation and death, like the UK, have much much higher levels of natural immunity; as many asymptomatic cases were not picked up in Europe and the US during the big waves, it is quite likely that large swathes of their population actually have had covid at some point.

Singapore has effectively zero natural immunity outside of the dorm cluster. That is a good thing, generally speaking, but it does mean that direct comparisons to the vaccination rates of most other countries underestimates the level of immunity that those other countries have. A high level of natural immunity means that parts of the unvaccinated population already have some immunity, and it also acts as a 'booster' of sorts for the vaccinated."

6766,hbg5uhy,"As an European in Italy at the moment, I dare to say that the only way to test Singapore capacity to deal with Covid is by starting to loose the restriction of mask wearing outside.
We lived all the summer without wearing it and our ICUs are empty. We have many cases, thousands of cases, but only tens in ICU.

From outside, Singapore looks like they curing the disease without being ill yet.

I want so much to go back to Singapore to my husband, but the idea of returning to a ""golden prison"" (because Europe is actually living normally at the moment) where there's continuous contact tracing, isolation in facilities if positive with mild symptoms, you're forced to wear your mask even if you are in the middle of MacRitchie with nobody in the range of 1km, makes me cry. Literally.
I've been dealing with a sort of PTSD since I've left Singapore in June and the idea that sooner or later I must come back, is really hurting me.

You could say: ""Then stay in Italy, you're not forced to come back here!"", yes, you're right, but it's very hard when your loved one, your family, is alone there and needs you. 😔

6767,hbg5ujs,"You forgot to add the lack of sick leave and terrible  healthcare system which causes people to show up at the ER when they are close to death, likely a cause of the obesity epidemic.

So yes, it really is about market research and adaptation (these two are a constant WIP) 

If Asia is your only option, I hoenstly wouldnt know where else i would start a business, malaysia’s been in lockdown only up until recently (healthcare sector is on the extreme edge of breaking down), indonesia (Huge wealth gap as well as high covid risks also not a tourist hotspot unless youre in the leisure and tourism industry), SK (pretty similar to sg, higher covid risks). 

also taking into consideration of the long run where there is a bigger consumer pool with a bigger disposable income and spending power.

6776,hbg7mt8,"The same factors regarding natural immunity are true with almost every other highly vaccinated country, just to differing extents. Many of those countries do have working healthcare systems. All of the major ones (UK, Israel, Netherlands, etc.) did have major waves of covid-19. Singapore is one of the most vaccinated countries, but whether Singapore has one of the highest rates of immunity is really not as clear cut as you think. 

In England, the best estimation is that ~94% of adults have covid-19 antibodies: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveyantibodyandvaccinationdatafortheuk/21july2021

That certainly puts it in perspective, I think. That is actually _higher_ than the adult vaccination rate in Singapore, which is 90% or below for every vaccinated age group: https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/update-on-local-covid-19-situation-and-vaccination-progress_2_September_2021 (See fig. 3)

On top of that, while they didn't give an estimate of antibody prevalence in children, it's certainly not the almost-zero in Singapore.

Sure, you might argue that the mortality rate in the UK isn't _that bad_, but it's not low and has not stabilised yet. It is currently about 2/million/day, or ~700/million/year.

6782,hbg95o1,"At the end of the day you make my point, to get full immunity people need to get covid, and eventually even if Singapore everyone will. Thanks to the vaccines, most won't even feel it. The restrictions are just delaying the inevitable.

6783,hbg9atm,"You have a point there, but it still strikes me as weird, isn't they always try to keep their supermajority? So they can make unpopular decisions and still take the hit?

IMO if they open up more, even though cases will continue rise, after a few weeks most of the kiasi people will realize they've been freaking out over nothing (no shortage of ICU beds, deaths relatively low and mostly among those with the combo of elderly/pre-existing condition + unvaxxed) and get on with their lives. Then they'll slowly change their tune once they get to enjoy more freedom."

6788,hbgac1d,"Even if that is indeed the only way, it is important to open up slowly so that caseload can stabilise at a level that is not too bad for the hospitals. That seems to be what the government is going for. That, of course, means you have to wait for the caseload to stabilise before opening up more, which is what is happening now. If it takes too long, that just means people who got vaccinated the earliest might need boosters, which is really not a big deal since Singapore has more than enough right now.

That's literally what is happening right now, as far as I can tell; people like you are asking for everything to be opened up because you suspect that hospitals won't be overloaded. It'd be nice if that's true, but you simply don't know that, you just think that. Personally, I'd be happy if that happened, since I already explained my circumstances. I am young, healthy, and vaccinated, I'll be fine and I get to see my family! I do, however, understand how people might have worries.

Also, that is a big if, since a booster shot might confer longer lasting immunity for example like the tetanus shot. If you look at the childhood vaccination schedule, you can see that actually most vaccines require additional doses several months-years later to give lasting immunity: https://www.moh.gov.sg/resources-statistics/nationally-recommended-vaccines"
6789,hbgadby,"&gt;What are we opening up you ask? We have done well, but there is more we need to do as we transition into a covid resilient nation. There are still many unknowns. We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #united in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to. We know it has been a frustrating time for everyone, but we ask for your patience as we do all we can to make sure that Singapore transitions into a covid resilient nation.

If there's one thing I've learnt, the one freedom a Singaporean wants is eating out. Give him that and he can be resilient about a lot of things"
6790,hbgasq9,"Sometimes I’m really amused about people teaching me how to do the business that they even don’t know about. 

It is about offline social entertainment. It doesn’t depend much on the footfall, but on overall willingness of people to go out. I used footfall as a proxy to show that people go out less.

And currently a large portion of it can be explained by unnecessary psychosis regarding covid cases, clusters and news.

It’s not dependent on Asia and viable in any other developed market."
6791,hbgbe4r,"This is exactly why I don’t understand the “stop worrying when cases go up” chat. The govt seem to still be using cases as the key metric, so if it goes up it’s a worry that lockdown is returning"
6792,hbgbhv1,"Between the full opening i wouldn't mind and this tortoise approach there's definitely a healthy middle way. Give us music, alcohol after 10:30, groups of 8. They are literally doing nothing despite knowing better."

So who wants to F&amp;$*?"
6794,hbgcac4,"Again, i said based solely off your response (meaning using examples you cited) because yes i have no idea whats ur business and have no intention of teaching you how to do business

6797,hbgckgb,"If we open up, there's gonna be more spread and cases are gonna increase. I'm sure everyone can agree on that. Whether or not this is a bad thing is another issue.

Now this virus is frustratingly communal. To the extent that you can even be at risk of getting it even if you don't leave the house yourself. This risk may be pretty negligible at the moment due to our state of restrictions, but if I remember correctly it has already happened here in Singapore to an unvaccinated senior who ended up passing away (I dunno how to verify, someone please correct me if wrong), and a lot more in other countries. If we open up, this risk is definitely gonna multiply.

The ease of spread of this virus makes it a situation of collective responsibility, where everyone in society is responsible for everyone else. It shouldn't come as a surprise then that those who want to stay home prefer that everyone else stays home too. I may not agree with that stance, but it is what it is, people have their own risk assessments."
6798,hbgckxn,How do you exactly know who is a foreigner and who is not? Sounds like you're just paranoid that you're surrounded by a majority of foreigners
6799,hbgcz59,"I believe that the recent decisions are bad.

I was quite happy with how the situation was managed previously, but now it looks that their plan is to keep the restrictions forever, which is incompetent, in my view.

If there is no such plan, then there is no point of keeping the restrictions as the vaccination / preparation situation cannot be improved significantly, since the huge percentage of population is already vaccinated. Which makes that decision bad again."

Just frustrated and disappointed, that’s it."
6802,hbgdhkg,"This is the middle way, though. Look at other countries that did manage to control covid somewhat; many are still stuck. You are insisting on comparing with countries that have gotten used to high mortality rates because they completely failed to control covid anyway. Reopening more quickly than case loads stabilise isn't really much more cautious than just full reopening, because you either way you aren't waiting for data to stabilise.

Essentially, the broad approaches are:

1. give up and reopen,
2. reopen slowly, and allow case loads to catch up before loosening further to ensure that the healthcare system can deal with the case load, and
3. New Zealand

As a matter of fact, till this week when Australia joined us, Singapore was considered to be the only covid zero country that is trying to make covid-19 endemic: https://fortune.com/2021/08/24/singapore-pivot-covid-zero-reopening-international-travel/ Sure, that are countries that failed to protect their populace, and they can do whatever they want because people are just used to the death happening everywhere. I'm not sure why that's a good thing."

6814,hbgfgdk,Well you can and nobody is stopping you. Lmao
6815,hbgfn7n,"Looking at the headline, I get the feeling that it is temporary due to the usage of “for now” upon glancing through the article it confirms my feeling. With further explanation from the government that they are in other words trying to assess infections rates(during the virus’s incubation period) as well as while they are testing pilots programmes such as vaccinated travelling. 

And to me i will much rather that the government act on the side of caution and give answers without a specified timeline then to give promises that they can’t keep. Though they should be more transparent about their decision making rubrics. 

Point being i dont understand how you came to the opinion that they plan to keep restrictions forever. Maybe if you care to explain your view on this point?"

6819,hbgg3es,"Imagine if everyone in Clementi and Woodlands were only allowed to be trucked to their office in the morning (no travel outside office building), and back to their HDB unit in evening (no travel outside the HDB block allowed, even for takeaway from eateries or walking in park), for almost 18 long cruel months. And their HDB units were shared with 6-8 other Singaporeans.

Half of those Singaporeans would have gone mad. The other half would violently riot against this and file lawsuits and police reports. 

Its pretty insane how we as a society so quickly normalised the absolutely crazy treatment of foreign workers, and kudos to you for recognising it."
6820,hbgg6i3,I feel we are going to contract COVID-19 someday in our life. Keep locking down is pointless.
6821,hbgghlh,What’s worse is that foreign workers who have relatives that died at their hometown would choose not to go back home since it is very difficult to get a re-entry permit.
6822,hbggq6o,"It’s quite simple in my view.

The question is: are we opening eventually or staying in this state forever.

If we are planning to reopen, what exactly is going to improve from the delay? Adding 2 more percentage points to the vaccination rate? Pretty much everyone who wanted to get the vaccine got it already. If we are moving to endemic, we must accept that there will be cases, deaths and ICU admissions. Any possible “pilot” will just confirm it since there is tons of data from other countries. Nothing can prevent that, this is the just the nature of endemic and there is no other country in the world that is better prepared.

The whole delay and ongoing paranoia with how the covid here is covered in media only makes sense in case reopening is not on the agenda at all. Then the whole set of actions becomes reasonable and can easily be explained with logic.

And that’s my main concern because this is the path to nowhere."
6823,hbggr0j,"&gt;Sounds like you're just paranoid that you're surrounded by a majority of foreigners

I didn't say a majority. I said a lot. Maybe I am paranoid, because I think I am literally talking to a foreigner right now. Clearly I'm just going crazy and you are just a local Singaporean right???

Do you not see the irony of you telling me there aren't foreigners lurking on this subreddit?

&gt;How do you exactly know who is a foreigner and who is not?

One way is by having them announce they left Singapore after staying here for five years."
6824,hbgh0sj,New Zealand would be the perfect country for you to live in. They go full lockdown mode when there is an on going case. No need for you to argue with others.

If only the impact of restrictions are equal too.

Those who are screaming for restrictions are usually those affected slightly by restrictions. If you ask them to share the burden of restrictions i.e. Donate their salary to help those affected financially, they confirm say no de lor please.

So if they don't want to collectively share the burden of impact of restrictions, why should we adhere to them?"
6827,hbghy9x,"Just curious, are you from Sg? If not, what made you choose to start a business here?"
6828,hbgi0xy,Can say the same for all the snowflakes here crying for everything to be opened up as if Covid was non-existent. Stop bitching and learn to deal with it.

6829,hbgjjzy,"If people nearby you farted and you can smell them, it means that the fart particles have reached your nose.

If infected people wear masks, they definitely can leak out aerosolized viral particles.

And bear in mind that they are wearing more layers (underwear and pants) and the fart particles still can leak through.

And also look at Sweden, no mask mandates, no lockdowns and yet their numbers are very well for a country far north."

6838,hbgmax4,"&gt; Just don't wear your mask outdoors if it's not a crowded place, I've been doing that this whole year and nobody really cares. Think the govt doesn't dare to change this outdoor mask rule because some kiasi pple will complain &amp; anyway the rule doesn't much affect the economy. But now that we're so highly vaccinated, it's pretty safe to go maskless outdoors.

Also if someone farted beside me wearing a mask, I probably won't smell it, just as I don't really smell cigarette too, but I am using single-use mask. Or, if apparently the mask are not strong enough..... there is always N95."

6854,hbgtlgj,UAE.
6855,hbgtrqd,"Best, we have no goalpost now.

We can go fk ourselves because there is no metrics to look at"
6856,hbgtyr2,"Sure. The point is to reduce the number of people that will need to go to hospital so even if everyone is infected, they can just stay at home instead. However, how many people will still need to go to hospital? Just like flu can have variety of seriousness, so does this Covid-19 and its still more deadly and have more variety than flu. If like say, previously out of 50 cases, 10 need to go to hospital, after vaccination, out of 200 cases, only 10 need to go to hospital. However, if the number of cases become 200 average instead of 50 average, the hospital will still need to care for the 10 people. 

Basically, what vaccination does is raise the threshold that the disease will overwhelm the system. Are you sure loosening all restriction will not overwhelm the system?"
6857,hbguxd0,"??? Means the society should all stoop down to your level? While we're at it why not we all go back to cavemen. Since that worked, right?

6859,hbgwdnv,"Dont get me and them wrong here - every single play by them has been within expectations in this gigantic experiment so far. The 2 weeks is for them to confirm their own hypothesis that it is true that hospital resources will not get overwhelmed. Any more - is just pure indecisiveness in my opinion admist this swarth of data since 70% vaccination. I hope this isnt a front for ""we secretly are appalled by the 200 cases everyday, 90% which are close to asymptomatic, even though we all keep saying we really shouldnt care about the actual cases and just want good resource management in hospitals""

Months and months of data might make this slightly more credible, but livelihoods cannot wait months and months. Neither is locking foreign workers in dormitories for years the most ethical thing. Bare in mind that despite what LW said, See Leng is just starting to tinker about how to go about this - nothing is open for them yet."

This “new normal” rhetoric is incredibly stupid. You can go back, treat covid like any other disease, once vaccines are at a high level as they already are. Singapore being weirdly cautious."

I'm not particularly happy with the way covid has been handled in my country, but at least people would stand up for their rights if the gov announced something like this.

I had one friend go to UK when his mother died in December, it took him about two months to get permission to fly back and his employer stopped his pay when the mandatory 5 day compassionate leave for the death of a close relative was over.

The permission thing for foreigners is a bit of an issue in itself tbh. I get new arrivals needing permission but people who have been living, working and paying taxes here for years can leave but only come back once they have permission, sometimes this is granted quickly, other times it can take weeks (and in extreme cases months).

Population density is a thing, and that determines how severely a cluster can ripple through their population. Even them having high risk activities such as concerts hit different when you realize many in the UK have their own transports and that they don’t have crowded malls / high congregation points such as public transport like in Singapore.

Any case here spreads exponentially faster due to just how closely packed our people are, so there’s really no point in comparing their rate of loosening to ours."

Nope. But some redditors are going to read the comments here and receive a wrong impression that most singaporeans are anti-restriction when in truth, these anti-restriction sentiments are partially driven by angry foreigners who aren't even living here or are thinking of leaving.

Honestly. There is no point continuing with this discussion. You are free to come here and spread your anti-restriction/anti-lockdown narrative. Just remember none of these concerns you and you are just mainly preaching to the choir"

Bullshit. We ALREADY have very strong evidence that the vaccines prevent serious illness quite effectively (90+%) EVEN FOR DELTA. 

Here's the question: Why do we care if people test positive while vaccinated if they aren't getting seriously ill? If testing positive for covid is the bar, we will remain locked down forever"

6941,hbjeejp,Exactly. The only question left to answer is how quickly people and governments accept everyone on the planet will be exposed to COVID at some point. The UK is much further forward than almost anywhere else in realising that. New Zealand is just delusional. In Singapore we're currently closer to New Zealand than the UK.
6942,hbjf16i,"The government are like a rabbit in the headlights, frozen with fear. All the empty talk of being COVID resilient is exactly that. They have no idea what COVID resilience looks like or how to get there. The government are every bit as fearful and in denial of reality as New Zealand. 

There needs to be a clear plan for a return to normal and a commitment to getting there. The sooner everyone is exposed to COVID and acquires natural immunity the better.

6973,hbkoavg,"I respect your opinion, but I don't agree.
I don't know which nationality you are, but one thing I've noticed in this last year and half is that our opinions are strictly biased on our culture. To Western people, the overprotection that Asian countries are applying is ""too much"" from our point of view, because we're not used to it. We've literally grown up like spoiled child, at the base of our laws there's the freedom of doing and saying whatever we want (of course with so many cons 😅) and so to us is very difficult to accept the idea that being caged in 700km² island (especially this, we come from places where you take your car and ride for hundreds of kilometres without trespassing the borders so a 30km wide island is a bit tight to us) is the only way to be free now. That's why in the Western countries it's been so difficult to make people accept that they must wear a mask or stay at home during lockdowns.
One thing I appreciate instead about Asian countries is the respect of the laws. I love Singapore, I wish I could never live in another country (well, Japan is my only alternative 🤣), I love the fact I can go out alone at night and no one would bother me, I love the kindness of people, I love the multicultural society, I love the fact that everything works as it should work. But this ""amazingness"" has also a ""dark side"", which I think (correct me if I'm wrong) is not so dark for Singaporeans (or Hongkongers, Japanese, Chinese...) who have a completely different mindset, and this dark side is the fact that many of us are paying a salty price to stay safe. We've been away from our relatives outside SG  for more than a year (and the opposite: people locked outside SG not seeing their children, wives or husbands); we've been accepting contact tracing despite our idea of freedom (try to do something like Trace Together in Europe and then you'll see the protests, it already happened in Italy with the Green Pass - and with our contact tracing app which is not used at all because people decided they didn't want to use it); we accepted the fact that they can come to our place and make us pack up our stuff in five minutes just to be moved in a facility with other strangers even if we are barely positive (in Europe something like that is UNIMAGINABLE, probably it'll make start WWIII 😅). We live in the fear that we can't even get some sun tan alone on the beach without the mask, because SDAs are always around...
It's really tough for someone who comes from a different culture and mindset. 😔
I respected all the laws of course, I really believe in the society SG has built over the years, but I have to admit that's been hard for me and my mental health has started to crack at some point.

Then, I've seen the way Europe is managing the Covid emergency and I've understood that another reality is possible, that at least we can get closer to the idea of ""normal"" we had before all of this happened. Singapore is not even close to normal, not even on the way. From outside, SG (and other Asian countries as well) is stuck at March 2020, and this hurts so much.

6976,hbkp25d,"Yes, I guess that most of us expats are not happy with the way our countries handled the emergency, but at least after almost two years we can say that we're really moving forward, while SG is still stuck at March 2020. Yeah, everything works perfectly, but nothing has changed since then. And this stasis is killing my mental health."

Even if you are vaccinated, you may still catch it and 'only' become a transmitter of covid, supposing you only have mild symptoms. This is the situation we will have to live with, and the masking rule, perhaps it should be enforced, until the 3rd booster is done for all, and found to be effective enough to roll back the mask mandate which is required now to slow down Delta, which vaccinated people are still catching it, and apparently from the Math, 10 in ICU out of 22 in ICU, in Singapore, were fully vaccinated."

&gt; SINGAPORE: All in-person visits to residential care homes will be suspended from Monday (Sep 13) after an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases among staff, clients and residents.

&gt; Forty-two cases across 18 aged care facilities have been detected in the past two weeks, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Sunday. “With the number of cases expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, we need to take further action to protect the vulnerable seniors in these settings,” the ministry added.

&gt; Visits will be suspended for four weeks, until Oct 11. “This temporary suspension of visitation will give us time to encourage more unvaccinated seniors to get vaccinated, and roll out the vaccine booster programme for residents of aged care facilities,” said the Health Ministry.

&gt; STAFF, RESIDENTS TO BE TESTED MORE FREQUENTLY

&gt; Employees, residents and clients of aged care facilities will be tested more frequently with Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) as part of efforts to “strengthen” the testing regime, MOH said.

&gt; The ministry also encouraged the next-of-kin of unvaccinated seniors in aged care facilities “to support and encourage their loved ones to be vaccinated”.

&gt; “Unvaccinated seniors may suffer severe illness if infected. It is also important for vaccinated seniors to receive the booster vaccination when it is made available, to ensure a continued high level of immunity and protection from severe disease,” the Health Ministry said.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Home-based learning (HBL) will be implemented for students from Primary 1 to 5 from Sep 27 until the end of the Primary School Leaving Examination, amid a rise in COVID-19 cases, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Saturday (Sep 18).

&gt; Primary 6 students will go on a ""study break"" before their PSLE from Sep 25 to 29, similar to the arrangements for the 2020 year-end national examinations, the ministry added in a press release.

&gt; ""This is to minimise the risk of school-based transmissions and reduce the number of students placed on Quarantine Order (QO) or Leave of Absence (LOA) prior to the examination,"" said MOE.

&gt; The written papers for the PSLE will commence on Sep 30 and end on Oct 6.

&gt; HBL for the Primary 1 to 5 students will last until the end of PSLE on Oct 6.

&gt; ""In view of the recent rise in COVID-19 community cases, MOE will be implementing additional precautionary measures in primary and Special Education (SPED) schools offering the National Curriculum in the lead up to the start of written papers for the PSLE. This will better protect our younger students who are not yet medically eligible for vaccination,"" it said.

&gt; Primary and SPED schools will remain open for students who require additional support during the period of HBL.

&gt; MOE Kindergartens, KCare Services and Student Care Centres will operate normally. Parents who are unable to work from home or secure alternative care arrangements can approach their children’s schools for assistance, said MOE.

&gt; To ensure the safe return of students to school, students are strongly encouraged to do an antigen rapid rest swab test at home on the following dates: Either Sep 27 or 28 for Primary 6 students; and either Oct 4 or 5 for Primary 1-5 students.

&gt; This will allow for sufficient time to take a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab test if necessary, said MOE.

&gt; ""MOE will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and implement additional measures to keep our school environment safe, where necessary. We urge all students and staff to continue practising good personal hygiene, adhere to safe management measures, and exercise social responsibility,"" it added.

7057,hdtqeex,"&gt; # No visitors to hospital wards allowed from Sept 24 to Oct 23, amid surge in Covid-19 cases

&gt; SINGAPORE - No visitors will be allowed at hospital wards for four weeks, from Friday (Sept 24) to Oct 23, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (Sept 22).

&gt; This tightened restriction came amid the rise in Covid-19 cases in the community, and with more cases detected among hospital staff, patients, and visitors.

&gt; This has led to ward closures and staff quarantine, putting a strain on hospital bed capacity and staffing at a time when more hospital beds are needed to care for hospitalised Covid-19 patients, MOH said.

&gt; The ministry added that from Friday, higher-risk patients - regardless of their vaccination status - will also have to undergo mandatory antigen rapid testing (ART) at the hospital emergency departments.

&gt; MOH noted that certain patient groups will be allowed visits on a case-by case basis, as assessed by the hospital.

&gt; This includes patients who are in critical condition, paediatric patients, those giving birth or post-partum mothers, and patients requiring additional care support from caregivers.

&gt; This also covers the assistance of inpatients who have mental incapacities or family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better care for their loved ones after discharge. Such patients will be allowed only one pre-designated visitor, for one visit per day.

&gt; Patients who are in critical condition may be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patient's bedside at any one time.

&gt; But all approved visitors will have to produce a valid negative antigen rapid test (ART) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result obtained within the last 24 hours of each visit.

&gt; ""This is a mandatory requirement for all visitors, regardless of the individual's vaccination status, except for persons who have recovered from Covid-19 and are able to present a valid PreEvent Test (PET) exemption notice,"" MOH said.

&gt; It added that all approved visitors must wear face masks with good filtration capability at all times, which includes surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabrics.

&gt; There will also be no eating or drinking in the inpatient wards. Visitors cannot use the patients' toilets in the wards and must avoid sitting on patients' beds.

&gt; Meanwhile, MOH is also introducing measures to help emergency departments (ED), which are usually crowded.

&gt; ""Currently patients presenting with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms at the hospitals' ED or 24-hour emergency clinic will be segregated from the other patients,"" MOH said.

&gt; ""However, with more Covid-19 cases presenting pre-symptomatically or asymptomatically, testing will be needed to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission at the ED.""

&gt; Hence, from Friday, higher-risk patients - regardless of vaccination status - will be required to undergo mandatory ART testing at the EDs or 24-hour emergency clinics.

&gt; This includes patients who are lodged in ED beds for prolonged observation in the short stay unit or Extended Diagnostic and Treatment Unit, or in the observation bay and wards in the private hospitals.

&gt; It also covers patients who need to undergo mask-off assessment and, or procedures lasting for 15 minutes or more.

&gt; Those accompanying these patients, who are allowed to stay with the patients throughout the observation period beyond 30 minutes, will also be subjected to the ART test.

&gt; The Government will subsidise the costs of ART for both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients until the end of 2021, MOH said.

&gt; Accompanying persons may have to pay for the tests, depending on the hospitals.

&gt; ""We urge those who have non-emergency conditions or mild symptoms to avoid seeking treatment at the hospitals and consult a General Practitioner (GP) or Urgent Care Centres instead,"" MOH stressed.

&gt; Those who are concerned that they have Covid-19 should to to a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic instead.

&gt; GPs there will assess the severity of the individual's symptoms and perform Covid-19 diagnostic tests when needed to confirm his health status, it added.

&gt; ""This will allow patients with more severe illnesses and who require emergency urgent care to be attended to quickly and helps to preserve hospital capacity for those who truly need hospital care.""

&gt; MOH has also increased surveillance testing frequency for hospital staff, as well as vendors who work in the hospitals.

There’s other areas we can push for opening for but hospital is not it."
7067,hdttrpa,If people followed the rules early then we wouldn’t be in this situation. It’s all because of Boomers spreading false information asking people not to wear mask and not to vaccinate that we ended up being in this situation

Of course, parts of Aus/NZ are under lockdown right now but that's only due to their lack of vaccine supply, some states in Australia have already come out with detailed roadmaps of what they want opening up when they reach certain vaccine milestones, while Singapore didn't do anything when we reached 80%.                       
As for EU countries, Denmark has quite a while ago stated that COVID-19 is no longer a disease of concern to them, and just yesterday Norway came out saying that COVID-19 is now going to be comparable to the Flu over there. Those are just the two countries that have explicitly stated this, countries like Sweden, UK, Netherlands, Switzerland, etc are more or less already living with the virus with either no restrictions or ones with very little interference on how human beings live."

Of course each of those 10 people had to find a dumb question to ask the counter staff slowing things down even more for everyone.

7099,he2plfo,"&gt; # COVID-19: Dining-in group size limit at regular F&amp;B outlets down to 2; social gatherings reduced

&gt; SINGAPORE: The group size limit for dining-in at regular food and beverage (F&amp;B) outlets will be reduced to two vaccinated people from Monday (Sep 27), while the cap on social gatherings will also be reduced, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Friday.

&gt; This comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases in Singapore in recent weeks.

&gt; The new restrictions will last from Sep 27 to Oct 24, and MOH will review the measures two weeks after implementation and adjust these measures based on the community situation then.

&gt; ""We do not need to return to a heightened alert. But we have to do more to scale back social interactions further in order to slow down community transmissions and allow for better stability,"" said MOH.

&gt; DINE-IN AT F&amp;B OUTLETS

&gt; Groups of up to two people will be allowed to dine-in at regular F&amp;B outlets if all diners are fully vaccinated. This is down from the current limit of five.

&gt; Unvaccinated individuals with a valid negative pre-event test result, recovered people, and children aged 12 and below may be included in the group of two at F&amp;B outlets, MOH said.

&gt; F&amp;B establishments that are not able to ensure that all dine-in patrons meet the criteria for full vaccination may only operate takeaway and delivery services, MOH said.

&gt; The rules for dining-in at hawker centres and coffee shops remain unchanged.

&gt; “Because hawker centres and coffee shops offer essential food services to the community, the concession to dine-in at these premises will remain at up to two persons, regardless of vaccination status,” the Health Ministry said.

&gt; Entertainment such as live performances, recorded music, and videos or television screening at F&amp;B outlets will continue to be prohibited, MOH said.

&gt; ""Patrons to F&amp;B establishments are also reminded to adhere to all safe management measures and keep their masks on at all times except when eating or drinking,"" the ministry added.

We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to.

How the table has turned vis-a-vis Malaysia, as their vaccination rate converges with ours and they are contemplate a further reopening of the country in October. 

The spat between OYK and LW re Covid-19 also reflects badly on PM's leadership, who somehow can't get the 4G to work/gel together.

But all they’ve been doing is posturing as if they know better or that they are above the common man when the fact of the matter is they have neither a clue nor the iron to do what should be done.

Pick a strategy and stick to it. The people voted for them at the height of the pandemic(not that they were given much of a choice) and gave them their “mandate”.

We have been steadily, and cautiously moving forward with opening. There will be chaos and uncertainty as we are psychologically unused to these kind of numbers.

Secondly, your theory has obviously failed. Look at the graph of vaccination rate vs number of cases . And we were coming out of lockdown where only vaccinated people were allowed out. So technically our infection rates have skyrocketed after people got vaccinated. I’m questioning the decision being subjecting 20 and 30 yr olds to the same restrictions as 70 and 80 yr olds . If you use some critical thinking you will arrive at the conclusion that it makes no sense.

And so what if they’ve been studied since the 1950’s? There’s a reason they’re illegal, they are not suitable for general use in bodybuilding due to the safety risks they pose. If they were of such a high safety profile, they would be generally available to the public, but instead you resort to buying them off of sketchy illegal telegram groups.

Again bad strawman, bad analogy. The covid situation in Singapore has not 'evolved' into something unexpected ever since the gov got caught with their pants down with the whole 'south asia' delta variant hooha. What has unfolded since then has been within their estimations and parallels what is happening in many other countries; none of this is some wild turn. They arent even adapting to anything, we've been making uturns between the same 2 traffic lights because our 'drivers' cant figure out the 'roadmap'. They have made statements and promises that they have reneged on within weeks. This isn't anything like what you've tried to paint with your analogy. This is more like you having dinner plans with your friends on a Saturday, and you keep changing your availability because you cant pick between going for dinner or staying home to wank.

Also I love the shifting goalposts of the pro vax crowd aka freedom surrendering crowd . First it was “ pls don’t be selfish and get vaccinated so we can stop this pandemic and I can get back to travelling because that’s my entire identity”. Now it’s “ oh the vaccine basically does nothing except stop me from getting very ill . And I’m 23 so I wouldn’t get very ill anyway”. It’s a joke. 

Marijuana is also illegal even though it’s been proven to be medically beneficial . You can get the death sentence for it. Also you’re severely underestimating the number of people in the general public on steroids. Lots of Policemen, firefighters, actors , celebrities , fitness models , and others use steroids recreationally and safely and it brings tremendous benefits to their life. You’re clearly talking about something you have no idea about. Yea vaccines are so damn safe but wait just don’t workout for a week you might drop from cardiac arrest. 

Again, I’m not here to debate steroids vs vaccines , they’re entirely different conversations and people should be free to take what they wish to. I’m debating the lack of personal choice in this entire situation , especially when it makes 0 sense to take a remedy for something you were never going to suffer badly from in the first place. Chances are I got more sick from the side effect of the vaccines then if I actually got covid. Add 2 weeks of missing out on exercise to that."

Its fortunate that you are amongst the group that understands the situation and can be responsible. But a large number of people are really super self centered and dont give a shit about this whole covid thing. The government has no choice, but to put these measures in place to stop these people.

Who here is saying open up completely? The debate is about not taking a step back AGAIN.

Even the Taskforce itself said a week or so back that cases are going to rise but they’re not going to take measures unless absolutely necessary. What’s changed since? This again was expected, it’s not as if the expectation is that it wasn’t going to increase. 

And the measure is a month of restrictions? Which again are half-assed because dining out is still allowed and no one can really monitor social gatherings. If there’s real concern, then do it properly instead of slowly bleeding everyone out.

Almost all of my friends whom are working in hospitals were assigned SHN for 14 days as they had come into contact with covid patients this week. From what I gather from them, they were already overstretched as they themselves were covering for other colleagues that had been given SHNs. 

This could just be the Singapore Government’s way of reducing the uptick in Covid cases to allow for hospitals to be able to subsist on their current reduced labour force. The hospital situation is quite bad though the number of ICU cases still remains low.

The point is that the gov has repeatedly stated that what they *wanted* to go down the route of opening up, not halfway measures. And in that regard they’ve failed miserably. 

I would have been ok with any of close or open btw. Just fucking stick to your damn plan, altho it looks like they don’t have one now.

It may or may not be, but I personally feel like at this point we are just being reduced to mere productive assets to continue working for the nation.

7775,he2ysy6,"Look at the thread on 2 more deaths and the responses from a couple of healthcare workers in there. Why don’t you go challenge them on how they feel on the ground?

The entire point about vaccination is that it makes most cases mild. Do we really need to know exactly how many cases we have if we want to treat it as endemic? Again, measures put in place to protect a small portion of the population and one which overworks the system. You can find the complaints about how the system had broken down because everyone has to be quarantined once there’s contact tracing. We are already past that and that’s why there’s confusion on the ground as to what to do."
7776,he2ywcu,"The problems with the home recovery scheme are a key factor in this decision. 

Even the government acknowledges that our Covid-19 protocols, which were designed for the ""Covid Zero"" era, need to be adjusted. Since the home recovery scheme is a vital part of this shift, unless and until they can get it to work, hospitals will remain overwhelmed (A&amp;E, regular beds and manpower, not ICU beds).

Perhaps they should have thought harder about how they would scale up the home recovery scheme (and other alternatives to hospitalisation) *before* easing measures with 66% fully vaccinated (I would rather they have waited until 80% and communicated that as the *start* of a *long journey* towards endemic living)."

They’ve already bought inventory for the relaxed measures. That stuff is going to spoil and no one is going to make it up to them.

But neither would be the best way. Delta is so transmissible that it will still survive despite a lockdown and remerge the moment you open up. 

And reopening completely is also not advisable due to our high population density and the impact it may have on the hospital system. Hence we need to manage it. Open but not too much.. close but not too much as well."
7789,he2zg3m,You are the problem

7792,he2zkze,"Diminishing returns is the iron law of any effort.

You don't need more hospital beds, you need to use those you have more effectively, for people that really, really need them.

The transition to endemicity in the presence of Delta unavoidably involves elevated infection rates.  The NPI is intended to **reduce,** not eliminate, transmission and it doesn't therefore have to be perfect but it must be **scalable**.  The current home self-isolation policy is just not scalable.  The issuing of QOs, daily ART tests and exit tests, does not get you a reasonable return for the effort and xpense involved.  Just impose a fixed legally-enforceable isolation period on cases and contact and scrap the supplementary testing.  But what if someone is still infectious after isolation?  It doesn't matter - you are aiming to reduce the rate, not eradicate.  You set the period on the basis of probabilities.  Remember diminishing returns.  The MOH should have more pressing issues to follow up than to keep track of a blizzard of QOs, test results, etc.  Breaking isolation still remains a crime but its perfect enforcement is not the most pressing issue.  Make clear rules so that the public don't need to speak to the MOH at all in the vast majority of the cases."

q a number of people i know ARE staying at home unless they rly need to do stuff, so that they won't contract COVID, skip exams, spread to family and go through all of the trouble to quarantine etc.

If MOH had been much clearer on what is expected for home recovery and had enough capacity to deal with the ppl recovering at home, the hospitals would not be flooded in the first place. Instead they took days to come back and forced C- vulnerable family members to QO with C+ people etc. There's a whole host of other problems people are facing on the ground.

I'm not saying we should be protecting them all the way but wouldn't it be better for the healthcare sector to find an adequate pace for them to work with and then slowly build up instead of just flooding them w tons of cases to help"

And relative to other countries, we are more pro-active in PCR testing asymptomatic vaccinated individuals. Maybe the portugese rather undercount because it helps with opening up (and the underlying unspoken rationale is fostering natural immunity). Not sure if it is the same for Denmark.

This was on Jul 26, point 60 onwards when MOH was outlining the shifts in protocol, the steps given was true endemic. But when we reach the stage to walk the talk, we failed to do it. My best guess is that within the MTF there is disagreements on all these, and add on to public pressure, there are compromises to go endemic with pandemic measures, hence things like buddy system came out last minute, and we end up screwing ourselves"

And this lock down applied to a state of 8 million.

Last year Victoria was in strict lock down (like Sydney's) for almost 6 months and are now back in.

And that's with almost 70% of adults single shot and 57% double shot in my state.

I get you guys are having are a hard time but Western countries across the world are in heavy lockdowns.

People in other countries don't mind getting questioned or arrested, because that's part and parcel of going against authority.

In Singapore, we've become indoctrinated into fearing that we have something to lose (mostly money and wealth, but maybe also the stigma of being called crazy, like what CSJ encountered), and we're more willing to just submit to our authoritarian government than disagree publicly and violently because of that."
7989,he3e9em,"Because ICU is still at \~20, and hospitals are filled with people who don't need to be there.

What we need is for the populace to get used to the idea that testing positive after vaccination is no biggie for 98-99%. You and your family stay home and self-isolate for 10 days, don't rush to the hospital for flu-like symptoms, register online for electronic QO to show your boss/school. Within the home, if don't have any elderly, pregnant women, infants or immunocompromised people, you might even choose to live relatively normally (as if it's the flu) and let things take their natural course."

7999,he3f679,They did not expect the vaccines to fail this badly. Delta is too much for them. And also out country's density meant using data from countries like Denmark and Germany is useless.

Easy to ramp up healthcare facilities. You can buy all the equipment, but no nurse/doc to man them. For reference, [in the US, it takes 5-6 years to train an ICU nurse](https://study.com/articles/careers-and-education/how-long-does-it-take-to-become-an-icu-nurse.html)"

8005,he3fok8,"That was *not* the point of that article. That article was refuting this idea of *sterilized immunity*, a state where anyone vaccinated is perfectly protected from any infection or disease. It was asserting that sterilized immunity was most likely impossible and even with that fact, vaccination is still the best way with dealing with this pandemic. 

If you are vaccinated, the likelihood of you catching COVID is significantly reduced, somewhere in the 80% to 95% range based on your vaccine and the variant. If you are infected, the likelihood of significant illness is drastically reduced, and the chance of death is almost eliminated.

If you can be vaccinated, and do not get vaccinated, you are an imbecile. You are so dumb you are a detriment to any society. You are also selfish, obstinate, willfully ignorant, and a danger to those around you. Propagating any doubt regarding vaccination makes you even worse. So shame on you, and I hope COVID makes your testicles swell to unimaginable size and causes all of the females in your life have flat, flaccid, veiny breasts.

As for Doctors/Nurses, it's time for the government to start sponsoring training programmes to train up people with prior clinical training to become ICU specialist. There are many nurses who left the profession due to the shitty career prospects, and I'm sure they will be happy to come back if the govt will sponsor them a 6 month training programme with a stipend and a guarantee of a good salary at the end of it. 

Doctors with different specialties like cosmetic surgery and dermatology can also be converted to ICU doctors with high pay as they surely aren't getting much medical tourism business now.

8070,he3peqr,"Ah. You just need to read a mix of comments to know the sentiments. You get some people saying “1.5k cases! Lockdown to be safe!” and “So called endemic give me my freedom” Both valid by the way; everyone has different challenges and needs in life. 

But I want to address the point about “what’s this tightening for? Hospitals not overwhelmed what, just 20 ICU cases” point of view. Yes, it’s “just 20”. But you need to see it in the overall light of ICU (or all hospital bed) needs. 

You can’t have every bed filled with Covid patients. You need capacity for the heart attack patients, the A&amp;E cases, the sudden collapse cases; anyone who needs an ICU bed. or even those who have major surgery and need a ICU bed for recovery. Plus hospital administrators need to plan for a possible increase in ICU admissions when there is a spike in cases, there is also likely to be a spike in hospital and ICU admissions. So yes, it’s just 20. But on the other hand it’s 20 less beds for 20 stroke patients, traffic accident patients, heart surgery patients etc. I hope we won’t ever have a case where our relatives are ill, need hospital beds and there are none cos govt didn’t plan enough. 

“But there are people who don’t need to be there!” Yes. This is a long-standing issue of lack of hospital beds and the authorities have been doing their best to address it from adjusting hospitalisation insurance claim amounts to having more step down care facilities and options etc. Frankly nowdays acute hospitals are trying to discharge people as fast as they can coz they need to free up bed space.

And the point on “there are these folks who only have minor symptoms but want to be hospitalised!” Point taken. This is coz in the early days govt drummed into us - if you’re unwell seek medical advice. They put covid cases in hospitals. Then community care facilities. Now at home. It looks like poor planning and mixed messaging. I personally see it as things keep evolving and the response to it has to evolve too. In the early days after seeing Wuhan and Italy etc you want people to take this virus seriously. Then with medical breakthroughs and research then there are treatments so things get better. Then delta comes and changes the whole game. This isn’t a standard response that you can copy paste from previous template. It’s ever shifting and there’s a lot of considerations and competing needs to take into account. Frankly I don’t envy the MTF; it’s a hard job. 

And lastly - “It’s so messy / Govt never plan properly” Yes. It is messy. You’ve got a whole lot of public servants trying their best to adapt to ever changing scenarios and plan properly. Yes there are screw ups and they should learn and not do it again. People shouldn’t be told they’re positive and left hanging etc like what’s been reported. But I hope we can give our public servants a break - they’re humans after all. And no, I’m not a pro pap sinkie or anything like that. I’m just a fellow singaporean minion who has seen a little bit of the many many covid ops. And what I’ve seen shows me that it’s tough to have to balance everyone’s needs; the ones up there are aware people are tired and frustrated. 

If you made it this far; thanks for reading. Just wanna say let’s just be kind to one another. Look out for the vulnerable. If we have good ideas, bring it up. Don’t be the armchair critic. Hang in there folks. Let’s try to get out of this thing together. ♥️"
8071,he3pfwl,"&gt;Almost all of my friends whom are working in hospitals were assigned SHN for 14 days as they had come into contact with covid patients this week. From what I gather from them, they were already overstretched as they themselves were covering for other colleagues that had been given SHNs.

This is what you call the ""idiot's guide to how to mismanage a healthcare system."" I understand quarantining HWs who test positive to reduce transmission but 2 weeks' leave for anyone who **may have contacted someone with covid** is *fucking madness*. It's 100% irrational and should make our public health response a laughing stock of other countries."
8072,he3pfwp,"1 week ago, we had 900 cases. 2 weeks ago, around 600 cases. Let's say that the current ICU numbers reflect people who got infected 1-2 weeks ago, 750 cases/day on average. Now that we have 1500 cases daily, we can expect 40-50 ICU cases in 1-2 weeks. This is still well within capacity. And cases don't seem to be going up exponentially anymore, and was expected to plateau at 3k before going down. The projected numbers said that we could cope, and I don't see any reason to change from the plan."
8073,he3pt78,"I'm looking at weekly case % change. Today its 67%, yesterday was 70%, day before that 74% so weekly growth of cases is lowering and will continue to. Now the government can claim it because they took action, it's not"
8074,he3q00h,I think marching to complain is 1) ironically stupid in COVID times as a super spreader event 2) not feasible in Singapore. So when the government does something the population hates what are the avenues for complaint?
8075,he3q1bk,"&gt;They didnt prepare enough and only prepared for icu cases. 

They prepared plenty. There are just far too many people with very mild cases in hospital when they don't need to be there. AND they're compounding the capacity issue by instituting SHN for healthcare workers who **even talked to someone with covid**...like a bunch of incompetent morons. **Obviously**, these people will be contacting covid patients. We shouldn't be arbitrarily taking them out of the system for 2 weeks unless they actually **have covid**."

the logic is simple, increase vaccination so that most of the people would only have mild to low syndrome if they catch covid, which wouldn’t stress the health services too much, and make easing restriction possible. 

the increase in cases should well be expected as the restriction is lifted, and the reintroduction of tough restriction seems counterintuitive.

&gt;When virtually no one fell ill after an inoculation campaign, researchers figured that infections had evaporated as well. Now, however, techniques are far more powerful, giving researchers the ability to zero in on even tiny blips of infection. Post-vaccination measles infections, though still uncommon, are much more “regularly observed” than they were once believed to be, Griffin said.  
&gt;  
&gt;As detection tools improve, each data point further erodes the mythos of sterilization.

Next I've already read those article of yours and it doesn't actually dispute anything. It basically just shows there are 5 times more people who are diagnosed with COVID are unvaccinated. It doesn't demonstrate those who are vaccinated didn't get COVID. Read the quote I just showed you again. Like I said earlier, more likely than not, the same number of people who are vaccinated are getting COVID but don't have symptoms and are not tested hence there seem to be way more unvaccinated getting the virus

We already know that is almost certain to be part of the reason because 98% of our current cases are asymptotic and we would not have caught them if not for the fact that we have one of the highest test rates in the world and we are literally testing for no reason

To add, my main post was made to highlight the difficulties that HWs (friends included) face. The government needs to encourage more people to join the healthcare industry by perhaps providing better financial renumeration to staff.

You may not see it this way, but those on the fence regarding vaccinations will - any challenge to the efficacy of vaccinations deters those who are not yet vaccinated. And even if you were correct, which you are not, all the data shows that those that are vaccinated are being hospitalized and dying at an astoundingly lower rate that unvaccinated people. Thus, VACCINES WORK IN REDUCING THE SEVERITY OF COVID ILLNESS, including incidents of “long COVID”.

I never disputed your point about vaccine making it mild. That’s a fact. My point is that it doesn’t prevent the spread . Therefore if you don’t take it, you are not putting anyone else in danger. If that’s the case, there is 0 reason to force it on people, especially if you’re statistically in an age group that suffers no ill harms from covid.

Irrelevant. We are calculating the cases, not deaths. The deaths (50) are an average based of an assumption that around 0.2% of the total population will die to covid based off current data. An increase in cases will lead to an increase in deaths, naturally

Which will basically annihilate our medical system even if we take into account herd immunity, and lead to around 50 or so deaths a day, perhaps even more since people often visit their grandparents, and our ICU will definitely overload . Also take into account even younger people can get onto the ventilator. 

If ICU's overload we're fked. Which is why it is logical to enforce vaccines on 20'3 and 30's 

Also, very sweet of you to assume I support the government's initiatives, which is kinda funny since you tell people not to generalize and say you're an anti-vaxxer. I'm honestly quite tired and I think it's unnecessary, glad we can agree with each other. The entire point of this argument was to debunk your argument claiming that the vaccine was not effective and shouldn't be forced onto 20's and 30's, don't know where you got the government vibes from. My calculations are fairly basic so they will not be able to predict with pinpoint accuracy the number of new cases but they are able to indicate the direction of what a certain action will entail."

8256,he7gz07,"1 step forward, 2 steps back"
8257,he7hn33,"You can't argue that the government is forcing people to take vaccines and cite the restrictions as the basis of your argument when you're also claiming in the same post that they don't force people to stop smoking, because the smoking restrictions aren't any different from restrictions from being unvaccinated (by choice).   
Both restrictions are designed to discourage a certain behaviour from the population and nothing more. Smoking restrictions are designed to be an inconvenience to people; you can't freely smoke anywhere (like that ""segregation"" example, you are limited to only certain areas to smoke) and there's a vice tax for it (you pay more, just like your ""pay out of pocket"" example). The restrictions for unvaxxed people are inconvenient, but you can either live with it (like the [boyfriend](https://mothership.sg/2021/08/unvaccinated-relationship-impact-commentary/) from the Mothership article), or choose to take the jab. Some, like that same boyfriend from that Mothership article, aren't even bothered by the restrictions at all. As long as no vaccine mandate exist, you cannot say that the government is forcing it upon them, they’re still exercising their right to not get the jab and walking around freely as unvaxxed people.  
It's also wrong to say that choosing not to vaccinate isn't harming anyone, because it's very clear that most of the serious cases are deaths are from unvaxxed people. You keep insisting that unvaxxed people in their 20s and 30s are fine, but those people have died in other countries that got wrecked with covid. Our [latest news report](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/unvaccinated-covid-19-patients-at-12-times-higher-risk-of-needing-icu-care-dying-compared) says that some pregnant women are in icu; I think it's safe to say they're in their 20s-30s. Some unvaxxed parents in other countries have died and left their children as ophans, and hospitals are overrun with plenty of unvaxxed people both young and old needing serious help, leaving other people who need urgent medical attention stranded. There’s a high price to pay to be unvaccinated, and the impact affects people like healthcare workers and loved ones. 

Lastly, the word ""irrelevant"" means it's not connected to what's being discussed. You asked ""Why vaccinate?"" and I replied with the benefits of the vaccine by saying that it improves your chances of having it mild. That answers your question and is relevant. You then changed goalposts by saying that it doesn't reduce spread and therefore my post is irrelevant, but that's not how English works, and I never mentioned anything about the spread. The vaccines do their job of protecting people against getting a serious form of covid, and that's why the government strongly encouraged people to vaccinate. Again, nobody is being forced at the moment because they're still walking around freely without getting jabbed in the shopping malls/hawker centres/void decks/etc and hanging out with their family and friends."
8258,he7t3m0,"I mean, in the article you linked quote: ‘“We are not giving up on getting back down to zero. That is absolutely what we are striving for,"" Hipkins said.’ 

Obviously they’re going to vacc up, it makes getting to zero easier and if they can’t contain it it will save lives.

But locking down only works if you do it hard and only, which NZ did and they are looking pretty good atm from what I can see. Qld did that and we beat it off, from a peak of 27 daily cases (higher than current NZ figures) to 0. Victoria tried to do it but they’ve had so many lock downs this year that people just weren’t following government direction. And NSW dragged their feet and waited too long.

It’s a bitch though, and unless we never want to open up to the rest of the world we were going to have to accept COVID sooner or later, though I wish we were even close to your vacc rate before then. You guys seem like nsw and Victoria though, where the numbers are high enough it’s too little too late to bother with locking down, except when necessary for hospital capacity."

8267,he2pny3,"&gt; # Work-from-home to be default from Monday as COVID-19 workplace measures tightened

&gt; SINGAPORE: Working from home will be the default for employees able to do so as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Friday (Sep 24).

&gt; This directive, which will take effect from Sep 27 to Oct 24, marks a tightening of measures. Previously a maximum of 50 per cent of employees who are able to work from home were allowed to be at the workplace at any point in time.

&gt; During this period, the 10-day ""snap"" work-from-home regime for when COVID-19 cases are detected at the workplace will be suspended, said MOH in a press release.

&gt; ""There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites for those who need to go into worksites to work. Social gatherings at the workplace will continue to be disallowed. Employers should continue to implement flexible working hours and stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace,"" said MOH.

&gt; The ministry noted that employees, contractors, and vendors who are unable to work from home are ""strongly encouraged"" to self-test weekly via an antigen rapid test (ART) to keep infected employees from going to work and keep their workplace safe.

&gt; ""Those who are able to work from home but need to return to the workplace for ad-hoc reasons may do so after testing negative via ART before returning onsite,"" added MOH.

&gt; SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES ""ESSENTIAL""

&gt; MOH also noted that vaccination-differentiated safe management measures, mask wearing, and proper distancing remain ""essential"" to ensure that large events can proceed safely for attendees.

&gt; Event sizes and capacity limits for congregational and other worship services, cinemas, MICE, live performances, spectator sport events will remain at up to 1,000 attendees if all are fully vaccinated.

&gt; Otherwise, only up to 50 attendees will be allowed without pre-event testing (PET).

&gt; ""The concession for children aged 12 years and below, who cannot yet be vaccinated, will also apply for these events. Such unvaccinated children may be included in a group of up to two persons if the child is from the same household,"" said MOH.

&gt; The ministry noted that there will be no change to measures related to marriage solemnisations, which are allowed to continue, with seating in groups of up to 2 persons, if all are fully vaccinated.

&gt; Home solemnisations will also continue to be allowed with up to 10 attendees. Otherwise, only up to 50 attendees will be allowed without PET.

&gt; ""We acknowledge that wedding couples have faced significant uncertainties over the past few months. Hence, as a special concession, wedding receptions may be allowed to continue with up to 250 attendees if all are fully vaccinated, and with a group size of up to 5 persons per table,"" added MOH.

&gt; ""All wedding guests must strictly abide by the safe management measures, and in particular maintain social distancing and avoid mingling with others beyond their own table. Given their higher vulnerability, we also strongly discourage unvaccinated individuals and the elderly from attending such events, as PET only reduces their risk to others but not the risk to themselves.""

8375,hetsmjl,"&gt; # S'pore unis move classes online to reduce spread of Covid-19 as cases continue to rise

&gt; SINGAPORE - Three local universities have moved to reduce the number of in-person classes amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in Singapore.

&gt; The National University of Singapore (NUS) said online lessons are encouraged, while face-to-face classes will continue within national safe management guidelines, while Nanyang Technological University (NTU) has sent out a circular to notify its students that classes would mostly shift online from Monday (Sept 27) until Oct 22.

&gt; In response to queries from The Straits Times, The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) said that from Thursday, lectures, seminars and tutorials would be conducted online with students returning only for practical and laboratory lessons.

&gt; At the Singapore Management University (SMU) and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), classes had already been mostly held online before the current spike in cases.

&gt; On Sept 9, SMU sent out a circular saying that all undergraduate classes would be online until Oct 10.

&gt; SUSS told ST: ""For the remaining physical classes which cannot be shifted online, we will adhere to the national safe management measure guidelines and consider postponing them, if further tightening takes place.""

&gt; The Singapore University of Technology and Design told ST that lessons for first-year students will continue to be in-person, while the rest of its lessons will move online.

&gt; This comes after the Ministry of Education announced on Sept 18 that all Primary 1 to Primary 5 pupils would be placed on home-based learning from Sept 27 until Oct 6 - the end of the ongoing PSLE examinations - amid a spike in Covid-19 cases.

&gt; The universities added that other Covid-19 measures such as the reduction in group sizes from five people to two would be in place on their campuses.

&gt; Last Friday (Sept 24), the multi-ministry taskforce tackling Covid-19 said social gathering sizes would be reduced from five to two people from Monday till Oct 25 to stop the surge in infections from overwhelming the healthcare system.

&gt; SIT added that all student development programmes, physical training and activities on campus will be held online until Oct 24, while the NTU circular said all co-curricular activities must comply with national guidelines.

I strongly believe you have no recourse here. 

On the bright side, the restrictions is not going to be forever. We can see that the government is pretty adamant in opening up, at the expense of the wellbeing of HCWs and the vulnerable people.

Here, I would like to beg you to tolerate with the inconveniences a little while more while the professionals are working to cushion the impact of reopening as much as possible.

So, it is never in their favour to lockdown forever. They might get you to TraceForever, SwabForever, and TestForever, but never LockdownForever. Simply is not in their interest.

The rest of the world has moved on, leaving us and few other countries behind. The government will be eager to catch up with the rest of the world. Now they are struggling to decide whether to sacrifice a few lives for Singapore to catch up with them.

I'm pretty confident they will eventually decide to sacrifices a few lives, let them die for the betterment of the country and businesses. They have another 2 to 3 yrs to do damage control for their political reputation. So no worries for them.

&gt; SINGAPORE: Singapore will extend its “stabilisation phase” for another month as more time is needed to stabilise the COVID-19 situation, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Oct 20).

&gt; The Stabilisation Phase, which kicked in on Sep 27 and was originally scheduled to last until Oct 24, was implemented to reduce the strain on the country's healthcare system. Social gatherings were capped to a maximum of two while work from home became the default arrangement, among other measures.

&gt; “Unfortunately, given the continuing pressures on our healthcare system, more time is needed for the situation to stabilise. Hence, we will extend the stabilisation phase from Oct 25, 2021 through Nov 21, 2021,” said MOH in a media release.

&gt; 

&gt; The measures will be reviewed at the two-week mark and adjusted based on the COVID-19 community situation then, it said.

&gt; ""We thank all Singapore residents for your cooperation with the safe management measures over the past month. The stabilisation measures have helped to moderate the rate of transmission.

&gt; ""However, daily case numbers are continuing to rise, and we are still seeing many vulnerable patients needing intensive care unit (ICU) care. To allow more time for the situation to stabilise further, and to protect our healthcare system and workers, we will need to maintain our existing community safe management measures.""

&gt; 89% OF ISOLATION BEDS FILLED

&gt; About 89 per cent of isolation beds and 67 per cent of intensive care beds in public hospitals have been filled, said the ministry. This is out of a total of 1,650 isolation beds and 200 ICU beds.

&gt; ""Even as the public hospitals continue to set aside more beds for COVID-19 patients, we have observed longer admission waiting time for these patients,"" MOH said.

&gt; Non-urgent and non-life-threatening care treatments have been reduced to alleviate the pressure on public hospital capacity and manpower. Private hospitals have also been mobilised, the ministry said.

We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. This is an unprecedented situation, and the next few weeks will be quite critical. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to. We know it has been a frustrating time for everyone, but we ask for your patience as we do all we can to make sure that Singapore transitions into a covid resilient nation.

8552,hhckvhz,"as a wiseman once said:

and if the result is lousy, what happen?

BOOOOOOOO

BOO TO PAP"
8553,hhckvm0,maybe got vaccinated travel lane-special pass.  Like JR pass (only for foreigners) can eat out and go to places without the need for 2 people restriction
8554,hhckw1z,This what I don't understand. Numbers haven't moved at all in one month - so... in another month they will magically start falling??
8555,hhckw3t,Best summary ever
8556,hhckwl1,This is actually a very good summary
8557,hhckwp5,Do you have a source? I used to think both reddit and the government are attacking a unvax as a distraction.
8558,hhckwvz,when you put politics infront of issues
8559,hhckx3x,Apparently there were just [134 ICU beds on Oct 2](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/icu-capacity-to-be-ramped-up-covid-19-treatment-facilities-to-have-3700-beds-by-end-oct)!

8563,hhckybj,"They got due credit for that in the 2020 General Election.

It's going to be a bit boring if they trot out the same reason to vote for them in 2025."

8565,hhckylb,"4 more years, people would have forgotten about it if covid becomes truly endemic"
8566,hhckzdf,Could have bought at least 1 or 2 ICU beds with all the money wasted on thermometers. What about the TT tokens that are no longer being used to trace anyone? Money in the bin. Fucking ridiculous.
8567,hhckzxk,"The gap between the world and us gets bigger and bigger. 

Young people are pushed over the cliff. They cannot socialize, go to study, meet their friends, enjoy life and travel.

8570,hhcl2lf,2HA become stabilization phase
8571,hhcl2yc,would love to see some change in Uni finals then.
8572,hhcl382,Again. You should realize that no tourist in the right mind will come here at the moment.

8574,hhcl6oz,"Not most. ALL. Scandinavia has 0 restrictictions. You can do everything and people do not wear mask anywhere!

So you made the right decision and I am jealous."
8575,hhcl75r,Hear hear
8576,hhcl77w,"Why people are so confused about this statement ah? The 1000 ICU bed figure is given in a worst-case scenario, where the basic services of the Hospitals would be significantly affected to accommodate such a situation"
8577,hhcl7b7,Our vaccination rate is one of the highest and yet case counts getting worse. Only one other country has managed this amazing achievement - the UK. Every other European country with comparable vaccination rates are comfortably living with the delta variant without any restrictions with no significant rise in cases.
8578,hhcl7v7,"Im probably about a decade older than the Reddit crowd here, but I’m still doing everything in my power to catch and spread the virus at this point. 9th core value is the way to go, good to see so many more people violating the rules nowadays as well"

8584,hhcl9gu,"Why are they still calling it a stabilisation phase?
Or even calling it a ""phase""?
Just call it a lockdown range"
8585,hhclads,Scrolled too far down for this
8586,hhclalq,Honestly Singapore is a joke at this point
8588,hhclbxp,You really annot help them...
8589,hhclbyn,"What's the benchmark to move out of this ""Stabilisation Phase"" - numbers, not dates. Do they know it? Why won't they say it?"
8590,hhclc9u,"Govt got complacent with measures n quarantine orders early, leak into the community then blame us. Lock down on off many times cause it's 'our fault'"
8591,hhclchd,"I think it almost doubled. 

Of why is so low at start , clearly where enough before the pandemic.

Singapore ranked as one best healthcare before."
8592,hhcld2t,i wonder if maybe it doesn’t make sense to expand hospital capacity if covid is deemed to be temporary
8593,hhcld3k,People is even getting tired of the copy pasta! 😅 I guess it's time to been different from the government and try something else
8594,hhcld95,Yes. Most surprising for me is that we do not even try to follow the world.
8595,hhcldi1,The light is here - the truck has hit u in the face
8597,hhcldv1,Now then start kan chiong
8598,hhcldw0,"They did well in 2020 and most of 2021. Now they show that they cannot adapt. They think people are like walking objects that they can control with if/else conditions and they will magically comply, then get really confused when they discover that people are, unsurprisingly, still people."
8599,hhcldys,"How do you propose to increase ICU capacity? Beds aren't the problem - staffing is. Train up another 100 ICU nurses, respi therapists, physios, crit care physicians, perfusionists, dialysis nurses, in 2 years. Good luck with that."
8600,hhcle8p,"No,  some govt contractors got very rich from them.
Same thing for the entry scanners for malls in the future"

8603,hhclg7i,you are in circle line
8604,hhclgm1,Assuming it comes true for nsw. Ireland said they want to lift restrictions then backtracked 3 days before iirc
8605,hhclgpl,This is probably the worst kind of isekai.
8606,hhclh2q,have fun! party for us that are suffering here 😔✊
8607,hhclhrl,stabilisation for how long wtf?? nov also if the cases don’t fall as much as they expect then extend to december is it?
8608,hhcli01,This is sad.
8609,hhclih0,"Also a good question! Our hospital beds/population is pretty low for such a developed country with so many old people. Open secret is our hospitals run at close to full pre covid, but I guess to the govt close to full means not full yet means don't need to build more?? Way beyond my pay grade unfortunately. My opinion only just guessing no pofma"
8611,hhclkby,So… 25?
8612,hhclkql,"Assuming average age in sg, most people have wasted 1/40th of their life following the restricfions of these clowns in charge"
8613,hhcll1t,"No lah. We have turned around multiple times, now don't even know which way is the nearest to exit."
8614,hhcllc5,This is so fucking embarrassing
8615,hhcllsg,So far they maintain the first 2 phase plan of lifting at 70 and 80%. Would seems ridiculous to stop at 90%.
8616,hhcllua,Pretty sure our R0 value has slowed down drastically. How is this not stabilisation - are they still aiming for an unknown low 3-digit number while still mouthing off about lights at the ends of tunnels?
8617,hhclmrh,Don't forget hiring tray return ambassadors instead of raising cleaners pay

8621,hhclp3c,"Calling it now, we’re in this until CNY where we’ll magically open up and lock down again after. Can we get one more ICU bed for Singapore’s reputation on the world stage."
8622,hhclp4p,Its all old ppl taking up the hospital
8623,hhclpek,It’s easy to set up ICU beds but the crunch comes from healthcare worker shortage…
8624,hhclqdd,Pretty soon they'll come up with thesaurus for all different phases up to 2024
8625,hhclqp5,"Relax, come GE time they just need to hand out $200 GST vouchers and all will be well. Throw in a couple of NTUC Plus! Points for good measure."
8626,hhclqrb,hello it is i
8627,hhcls0h,"I’m in my mid 30s, I thought Reddit age was around 25"
8628,hhcls8v,"They aren't tourists though, they are largely people coming back after leaving to see family."
8629,hhclt02,This
8630,hhclt2v,"Some people may be able to live without a social life, but most certainly can’t. Singapore’s in a sad situation, being unwilling to open up. 

It’s super demoralising when you see other countries with packed sport stadiums, open nightclubs and no mask wearing, even on trains. What has our previous struggles sown? Nothing but more flip flopping and restrictions."
8631,hhcltlk,4k includes art test iirc
8632,hhcltsx,"Tbh those younger students and working people are mostly ok with the measures, but the teens who want to socialise and the older generation arent happy at all, which explains the overwhelming negativity to the news on reddit"
8633,hhcltuu,"Damn tired of this restrictions month after month.

I wanna get out"
8634,hhcluhd,"Seriously, what is the MMTF doing? That one month stabilisation phase was meant to expand hospital capacity, yet at this point of time our hospitals cannot take it right now, so have to extend the stabilisation phase by another month. What were they actually doing for this one month? This news shows that the MMTF is a bunch of incompetent, overpaid and lousy bunch of ministers. The ministers really need to wake up their fucking idea and do something to ensure that COIVD cases can be brought down and the draconian restrictions we are facing right now can be lifted.
I really have lost faith in the SG government after today.

All I can say is, what kind of world does the MMTF live in?"
8635,hhclv51,IIRC the GE had to be done latest by April this year.
8636,hhclv5r,FFS. Complete joke at this point. The people running the show have no consideration for people's mental and social health. Expected with VTL they'd loosen up but it seems true that to have dinner with your family you have to head to Europe
8637,hhclv73,I think they mean that they are able to convert 1000 hospital beds to ICU beds in the worst case scenario. But then again without the icu staff there’s not much point.
8638,hhclvcz,"Noone of them are tourists.   
(1) citizens PR

(2) long term pass, 

(3) visitors visiting relatives."
8639,hhclvlk,"Not surprised given the number of cases is not decreasing. Also, it is ridiculously annoying to see them keep changing the name of the phases. Like just be upfront and say this is phase 2HA or whatever shit."
8640,hhclwkd,They had masks previously just not Sweden. But now it’s back to normal so I’m glad!
8641,hhclxg8,"&gt;Why people are so confused about this statement ah?

Because Ong Ye Kung didn’t make it clear that it’s for worst-case scenario?"
8642,hhclxn9,Eh thanks la. I will think of you guys 😌
8643,hhclxv6,VTL flight is booked. I’ll make sure to drink a beer at 11pm after going to a football game with 40000 random people and no mask! See you when you go back to your senses Singapore
8644,hhcly89,i believe the hospitals have always been strained (even before covid)so it wouldn’t hurt if it is expanded permanently to a certain extent
8645,hhclyp5,Don’t forget the claps and cheers and social media hashtags!
8646,hhclz8g,"So good, meanwhile I'm stuck here attending to patients (HCW Privilege apparently, no pay increase just claps)"
8647,hhcm0lm,That's not the impression i got from their comment.
8648,hhcm1p0,Look at sg....
8649,hhcm1rx,Like the East Coast plan
8650,hhcm2z8,Because he also acted like it was being done already iirc.
8651,hhcm3jk,Totally understand where the crunch is - but whose fault is it that there is this crunch in the first place?
8652,hhcm4tr,"You would think so but I doubt it, considering how stupid and easily bought sinkies are. Throw some vouchers here and there, maybe some new bubble tea craze comes along, attention diverted, everyone forgets in years to come. I fucking gave up on this pos country"
8653,hhcm5kb,Our hospital/ICU load would drop by around 40-50% though.
8654,hhcm5mz,Hey I’m sorry they didn’t treat you guys better (seriously a huge pay rise would make sense). I have family working in healthcare too. Mostly in nursing and I do feel for them. Thank you for all the work you have done.
8656,hhcm7fw,Well I guess claps are more rewarding than providing good wages and recognition for the sector…
8657,hhcm7sm,No it must be the background music from JBL speakers
8658,hhcm7tx,If they extend again then honestly fuck them cos sch holiday gone lol
8659,hhcm89h,Test and learn with confusing flowchart full of loopholes

8665,hhcmbdu,"It’s not a flip flop, because by this point it’s just a flop!!"
8666,hhcmbl5,"Yes and it’s the authorities’ fault for this understaffing to happen in the first place. 

A well developed country like Singapore shouldn’t have this problem. 

Who has to bite the bullet: the already overworked health care staff and the rest of the population with these draconian social distancing rules."
8667,hhcmbn3,seriously feel horrible for the f&amp;b workers. getting fucked non stop for 2 straight years by our wonderful govt.
8668,hhcmc2f,"Hey no need to be sorry. Do enjoy the holiday, we all deserve it after ""stuck"" here for a year or two. Just stay safe and explore the world haha"
8669,hhcmc57,FFS Just make it 5 people per group already. No difference between 2 and 5 anyway.
8670,hhcme3o,The light at the end of tunnel is just OYK shining torchlight at you

8673,hhcmh9d,This country is turning out to be a fucking joke.
8674,hhcmhp9,Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
8676,hhcmik1,Pretty sure they kept writing just enough to tell people there was a complete script somewhere
8677,hhcmiro,Yeah but they're less vaccinated than sg i believe
8678,hhcmizd,Do you guys think the spike started after NDP parade on august 21? seeing the chart it rose upwards and before aug 21 cases were low...
8679,hhcmkk5,Hehe thank you!! Yeah I just need a break from here. So much has happened. Would be nice to start the year on a high
8680,hhcmlpk,gg multi millionaire task force
8681,hhcmlzx,Well fuck.
8682,hhcmm25,Mtf wont care lor. It's not their business or livelihood
8683,hhcmm4h,"Really? Look at MSM FB pages, many are cheering and asking for even tighter measures. And those posts come with many likes as well.

And if you disagree with my comments, you don't have to downvote. For a community that champions open and free discussions, I wonder why the mass downvotes if I'm sharing any pov."
8685,hhcmnvo,the no background music one really really confuses me. Why not just require a maximum allowable volume of music?
8686,hhcmo4j,Same
8688,hhcmodq,10:30pm curfew??? which sg you living in
8689,hhcmpc3,VTO!
8690,hhcmpcs,Personally kinda happy meaning my wfh is extended another month of chill and free pay 😎 before the tighten measure it was alternating week
8691,hhcmq2l,"Well we can look at the exact statement made:

&gt; For ICU beds, which are required for the critically ill COVID-19 patients, we can open up to around 1,000 such beds if needed. Today, even though we have only a handful of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, we have already opened up close to 70 beds, which is double from two weeks ago and we are preparing to open up more ICU beds these few weeks.

So the 1000 beds were not already present and set aside, but a possibility if things got worse."
8692,hhcmqbx,POFMA and FICA. I wonder what’s next?
8693,hhcmr2b,"Gahmen: ""We should not be paralysed by fear of Covid!""

Also Gahmen: ""Restrictions! Restrictions! Situation not looking good!""

Knn."
8694,hhcmsr4,Here here!  Just without the return.
8695,hhcmva4,Are there any VTL flights left next week 😂
8696,hhcmvdp,Serious question - are there issues with bringing in more doctors and nurses (e.g. from other countries) to man the expanded ICU capacity? Like is there a supply crunch or something?
8697,hhcmvot,2k to 4K call stabilization power la
8698,hhcmw1k,MTF doesn’t care. The only way is for your big boys in tech to pull out.
8699,hhcmw8k,"Yeah I talk about today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Denmark even had a lockdown. BUt yes they are back to normal."
8700,hhcmwe4,"If cases go down , its cause of their genius restrictions and lockdowns. If cases go up,  its citizens fault for not listening"
8701,hhcmwkz,"But what’s the end goal!? We are extending so that……? 

Build temporary hospitals? Buy more ICU beds? Hire more nursing staff? 

Just saying “stabilise” can still mean x thousands cases a day, x hundred hospitalisation a per week and if capacity isn’t growing then we’re just going to extend again…."

8705,hhcn0nx,And no roadmap
8707,hhcn1hd,Ikr. Singaporeans can be so easy to please . Just throw them a couple of hundred dollars and all is good. Loved complaining but don't put much actions to affect change.
8708,hhcn25p,"Ok so I understand this “peak has to peak” thing, that’s what’s gonna change in a month, however, it’s not like they couldn’t look at literally any other country in the world that went through this and understand it’s gonna take more than 1 month, and prepare the population with the messaging."

8714,hhcn5le,I'm so fucking crushed
8715,hhcn5yc,"They are on par with the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, all of whom have lifted all restrictions."
8716,hhcn66k,"Oh no,  pofma time"
8717,hhcn70n,Then after that have to extend to CNY

8721,hhcn9uq,"Well other people have raised the problems with the government’s solutions, but really this is all reflective of a mindset of cowardice. 

I gladly got both shots, and if I have to I’ll get a booster (but I doubt it cos I’m young), but this sets a precedent of moving goalposts. Next thing you know, we’ll be in groups of 5 on Christmas 2022 and with the Causeway still closed because “only 25% of elderly have taken their 5th shot/3rd booster”.

At this point they’re threading an untenable needle: they’re unwilling to mandate the booster for vulnerable populations, but not willing to really open up for most people either. That will materially hurt us in all the ways: people will still die and our healthcare system will be badly stretched for a loooong time, but FnB and entertainment and all sorts of other industries will be stuck in limbo, not to mention our potential demise as a travel hub."
8722,hhcna9q,Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!
8723,hhcnb3u,What risk. Mtf say it's super safe
8724,hhcnb5t,Other countries vaccinate to open up; we vaccinate to have more restrictions.
8725,hhcnb8d,Yeah I’m wondering why the cases spiked so high to the thousands. I mean the period where we had 5 pax dine in wasn’t this bad right.
8726,hhcnbht,Jaded. Truly jaded
8727,hhcnbjo,"where's your data from 

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vaccinated-travel-lane-passes-enter-singapore-8-countries-caas-2241246

CAAS said it is allowing up to 3,000 VTL travellers to enter Singapore daily on average, including citizens and permanent residents, short-term visitors and long-term pass holders. 

how do you know the short term visitors are all indeed 'visitors visiting relatives.'"

8734,hhcndxz,Is wfh as default extended as well?
8735,hhcnfg5,"Doesn't, if your ART is +ve you stay home until your ART is -ve. Or, if you show symptoms, then go to a SASH clinic for a 2nd ART and PCR test. So if someone is symptomless at home with ART +ve, not counted. Which imo is fine, since it shows the benefits our vaccinations have had that we can have COVID cases recovering at home.

(eta: also false positive ART is more rare than false -ve ART from what I read)"
8736,hhcngpy,So... we (collective we) still don't have our sh!t together?
8737,hhcnhmf,Waiting for molnupiravir while collecting paycheck.

8740,hhcnj9y,"Who was the health minister for most of the pandemic? Ah yes, it was Gan Kim Yong, he of the infamous “100% vaccination is not enough.” Maybe now we know why he favours Zero Covid…his health system could not cope with any other approach.

8742,hhcnjmv,ROFL. We were one of the best nation dealing with COVID in 2020 while people in vast majority of countries were literally dropping dead on the streets. We were one of the fastest nation to roll out vaccine while nations who did well last year like Oz and NZ struggled to do the same. Meanwhile clueless r/sg be govt exposed to be bad. Really show how clueless and lacking in perspective r/sg really is
8743,hhcnkg6,I'm no expert but something tells me that $640million can pump into healthcare to boost it

8752,hhcnqm9,MOH cut the number of universities allowed to apply for medical license in Singapore as the number of doctors in Singapore was “sufficient”.
8753,hhcnrfg,"Honestly rules like this are just made by people who feel life is too easy and they need to play on hard mode.

They just like making up more and more rules.

I don’t believe there is any scientific evidence to support the idea that this rule will reduce COVID transmission.

This was just a rule someone wanted to make up and then rode on the COVID agenda"
8754,hhcnrx6,Hey thank you!!! Haha still a while to go but I’m starting my count down
8755,hhcnrze,"Only Reddit and Facebook seems to care about this, and YouTube comments are just a shitshow"
8756,hhcns7u,"What’s the point of opening the borders when our country is “closed”? You’re lying to yourself if you think VTLs are “safe”, given how it takes a few days to test positive for an infection. 

Anyone could get a test done (72 hours before flying) go to a 2 day rave, no mask, in a crowd of thousands, get Covid but test negative, fly back, test negative again upon landing, then infect the community, cases go up, restrictions tighten again, repeat. 

But then again who tf would wanna come here if everything is 2 pax and TT compared to ownself-check-ownself in other western nations? 

Can’t wait for GE."

8844,hhcphp1,"These countries have substantially higher natural immunity and many of their most vulnerable are already dead. My relatives are from the Netherlands and there had substantially more restrictions than us last year and the beginning of this year (albeit with less enforcement). Like it or not, our cases are going up and I have yet to see any country in the world (bar maybe the UK) drop all restrictions in the middle of a huge wave. All countries which we like to cite as endemic examples have achieved stable case rates. Meanwhile we have 90% of our hospital covid capacity filled and its just going to keep going up.

Furthermore, while these countries have lower vaccination rates, they have higher elderly vaccination rates and covid is a disease which is exponentially more serious for the elderly than those of younger age groups. Hence having a high elderly vaccination rate is more important  than having a high overall vaccination rate. 

Everyone is so frustrated with the restrictions as am I. But I really don't see a way we can have a sort of ""freedom day"" without destroying the healthcare system. The protocols already allow for home recovery, community care facilities and the hospitalisation rate has been relatively stable but it's already running close to its max limits. I really don't see any short term measures which can drastically reduce the hospitalisation rates, unless we really just let everyone recover at home and only send those who are at the brink of death to hospitals (something the older generation will never be in favour of). We're really paying the price of being a covid naive society and not preparing for a pandemic pre covid (which lets be honest no one would have anticipated)"

People should not be gathering in groups larger than 2. So groups or even families who have to sit at separate tables is something that should not be happening anyway.

Since the OECD data [here](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/en/data-insights/intensive-care-beds-capacity) is measured in beds per 100,000 pax, converting to that would give us just 3.51 ICU beds per 100,000 pax. 

If we compare Singapore's figure of 3.51 against the rest of the OECD countries listed in the data above then it would reveal a significant underinvestment in ICU bed capacity.

Look at this list. Italy has three times our beds per person but still suffered ICU capacity issues during the height of their pandemic.

What you’re saying is basically that our healthcare system capacity is so coincidentally aligned with covid induced demand on ICUs, that if we gave healthcare workers what they wanted (which has nothing to do with covid btw it was an overworking issue) it would have somehow magically exactly met the current covid related demand spike?

9122,hhd0csm,"Nope, not being sarcastic. Yes, I am for reduced number of deaths first and foremost. And my main concern would be for my parents, which would be in the more risky category.

But that also doesn't mean that we don't live our lives, right? Regardless of whether you like it or not, life moves on. Heck, even my parents will agree. They got their booster shots and will live life however they can, within precautions. Probably even more winter crazy than me. And another month of this is going to drive me more nuts.

I have already said already - even if I am more cautious, I am generally still pro-opening. I would be more pissed if due to healthcare overload, unnecessary people die. I am also not giving gov a pass for not planning as well as they could have.

Nuance la. I hate it that people are lumped into either 100% open or 100% closed - it is somewhere in-between right?

In fact most of my posts are against those who show zero empathy in their pro-opening arguments, or spout bad ideas (e.g. don't publish news).

As we open (and I agree with this in general) people are going to die. We have to remember that these people are not just statistics, but are parents, grandparents and friends and family. We can show empathy and not be jerks.

And yet we still have to live our lives, because it is short.

However I can see where these people are coming from - the other analogy is that the handling of this pandemic has shifted in metrics over time; before vaccinations it was how well you prevent deaths (SG scores 10/10), then there's the metric of how fast you get people vaccinated (SG scores 8/10) and then finally the metric of how fast you give people their normal lives.

* limiting vaccinated people eating at a table to 2 people, including not allowing families to eat at separate corners of the same restaurant (if they booked 2 tables separately then can though),
* having no music in f&amp;b (allowed at numerous other buildings, malls and other venues though),
* shutting foreign workers in for 2 years in horrible conditions,
* limiting social visitor numbers (unenforceable),
* forced to wear a mask outdoors with huge distances between people,
* 1030pm curfew,
* no wind instruments, 
* arbitrary distances between diners in restaurants that are inconsistently enforced,
* banning team sports despite allowing plenty other similar activities with higher number of participants (church, convocation, gym classes and so much more are all allowed to happen),
* checking in TT every building and most shops in a country where the sick are meant to stay home and self recover and 98% people are asymptomatic so no meaningful tracing can be done

The taskforce should also tap Paul Tambyah to be a member of the taskforce since he is the head of International Society of Infectious Diseases and an infectious disease expert. Instead we have parrots (shall not name certain infectious diseases experts) who parrot the G's decision in CNA interviews and change their view every few days. However, they will never ever do so just because he is member of SDP.  Be the greater man/party and keep politics out of this, we need to overcome this covid shit together as a country.

Also, ENDEMIC MY ASS... They should just open up since we have achieved 84-85% vaccination rate and it is reported that covid vaccines are 'supposed' to protect one from serious side effects. For the unvaccinated (those who are medically able to take the vaccine), it is your choice if you are an anti-vaxxer but why should you hold the country hostage by your selfish actions.

We are paying the price right now as we are trying to reopen, however we want to pay as small a price as possible. The one who wins in the end isn't the one who gets there first. The end goal is not to get to reopening as fast as possible, its to get there with as little life loss as possible and compared to just about everyone else, we are winning. It's incredible how many people have loss sight of the most important aspect of dealing with the pandemic 

While I don't agree with the lockdown because I think it is unnecessary if healthcare resources were better utilized. I have problem with making people take ART unnecessarily.

Anyway, reiterating that I'm not in disagreement with you. I'm talking about the other aspects of the reopening.

Don't have high hopes for Nov 21 either, cases will unavoidably increase if we decide to reopen which means even more pressure on healthcare again. Really seems like healthcare overload is just an inevitable thing now, seeing how all the other countries that have successfully reopened have had that happen to them at some point. I guess Covid is as much a force of nature as a tsunami or an earthquake, you can try your best to limit the damage but in the grand scheme of things shit will still hit the fan hard enough to knock it off and there isn't much you can do to prevent that entirely.

I sincerely hope Australia succeeds. Not just because it'll show that it can be done without the healthcare system collapsing but also that it'll make it clear where the shortfalls in our own pandemic management lie and exactly what we need to do to fix it."

You need years to train nurses and doctors and 2 years in the pandemic is simply not enough to do so especially when compounded by increased demand for hcw everywhere now. Guess the road ahead will be to either maintain the current strategy of balancing lockdown and opening up at the cost of lifting restrictions slowly or to simply open up but accept a much higher death toll especially since the healthcare system will most definitely be overran in the case of the latter.

It would be bearable if we saw any signs of improvement or a willingness to refine some of the more unscientific rules, but this government can’t seem to admit where it’s been wrong."
9429,hhdy2q5,"The rules are not without reasons. Try evaluating yourself or enquire about them before criticising.

Re background music. Virus is spread through aerosolised droplets. The louder one speaks, the more aerosol droplets and the higher risk of spread if the speaker is infectious. Maskless activities are particularly high risk because there is no mask to reduce the amount of droplets. Presence of background music leads to people raising their voices and therefore more droplets and higher risk of transmission. That's why there are also campaigns and ads on public transport for people to keep silent and not talk. 

I would have thought that this is pretty obvious."

9439,hhe0yhe,"I'm just asking for some sense in the restrictions and reviewing them individually to remove the security theater measures that A) continues creating an atmosphere of fear in this country and B) makes life miserable when they all add up, especially as many of them have been ongoing for almost 2 years now. 

Bullshit like no team sports, no music in F&amp;B, not allowing restaurants to open past 1030pm, shutting foreign workers in for 2 years in horrible conditions and persistent contact tracing in a setting where contact tracing no longer works. 

But I guess I'm asking for too much. Easier to just use a sledgehammer style approach. Who cares if it creates more fear and is contrary to pm LHL's message, it's not like you people can protest or fight back or anything lmao."

But we are not taking any chances as we must preserve our buffer capacity.  Mr. Leon Perera had asked about our ability to further ramp up.

1. You will pull medical personnel away in order to provide a detailed medical diagnosis

Imagine if there are thousands that need to be prosecuted for not vaccinating. How long do you think it will take?

3. If the pandemic is not over by the time ou start jailing then, then you would be clogging up the prisons. Then you create an amazing environment for the virus to breed and mutate by putting so many unvax together 

You compare it to NS but that is exactly my point. An NS defaulter will be jailed but he still would not be serving NS. That's why a vaccine mandate is useless. You cannot force people to do something that they don't want to do.

The numbers with Delta variant don't seem to be quite so impressive, but your fivefold number is still on the low side. So halving the number of hospital cases, or more usefully, doubling the number of daily cases without increasing the hospital load, could easily be done with mandatory vaxxing."

9563,hhfptk2,"In all seriousness, this was always going to happen at some point. The previous super low case count was only possible due to strict testing and quarantining of everyone who even might have been exposed. Total ring fencing. Once we got a point where asymptomatic spread started happening, due to high vaccination count, this spike was inevitable. It's happened the same way in every other country, and in many countries its been a lot worse.

No, the question here is, WTF has the government been doing to prepare for this? Or not doing, more like. Since the spike was inevitable, predictable, guaranteed to happen, why wasn't the elite scholars club ready for this? They couldn't even staff a damn phone line properly."

9681,hhcjln0,"&gt; # Singapore's Covid-19 measures to be extended till Nov 21, to be reviewed at 2-week mark

&gt; SINGAPORE - Singapore will extend its Covid-19 restrictions until Nov 21, as the country's healthcare system is at risk of being overwhelmed.

&gt; Nearly 90 per cent of the country's 1,650 isolation beds have been filled, while two-thirds of the 200 intensive care unit beds are occupied.

&gt; ""The workload on healthcare workers and hospitals is therefore very significant,"" said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung at a press conference on Wednesday (Oct 20).

&gt; He added that his ministry is working to support and bolster hospitals, including beefing up manpower, but that this will take time.

&gt; The extended measures - which include capping group sizes for social gatherings and dining in at two - will be reviewed at the two-week mark and adjusted based on the community situation then.

&gt; ""It doesn't mean all the measures will have to remain frozen or static throughout this entire month,"" said Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force handling Covid-19 with Mr Ong.

&gt; Instead, the Government will review measures in certain settings and consider making changes in these areas first.

&gt; A $640 million support package will be rolled out to support businesses affected by the extension of tightened restrictions, Mr Wong said.

&gt; This includes 25 per cent of wage support for sectors such as F&amp;B and retail, as well as half a month of rental waiver.

&gt; ""This phase will not last indefinitely,"" he added, urging Singaporeans to understand the need for the measures and support them.

&gt; ""At some point the wave will peak. We will also have better immunity against the virus as more people get exposed to it, and we will have more people having boosters in the coming weeks.""
