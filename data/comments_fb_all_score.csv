All other flights to Singapore are bringing onboard CITIZENS and PERMANENT RESIDENTS, as well as approved work pass holders employed in Singapore. NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED - and it has been the law for OVER A YEAR.

And all of them have to get tested upon arrival and serve a Stay at Home Notice of 7 to 21 days depending on the origin country of their departure (it's the latter for anybody with history of travel to India) - and then have to get tested again before their quarantine ends.

Singapore has instituted extremely strict filtering rules that bar most of the travelers from coming in, while placing multiple conditions on everybody else, so that the virus is not transmitted into the community.

In addition it suspended entry of all non-resident pass holders coming from India, even if approval was issued beforehand - TEN DAYS AGO. Seriously...

So, as we speak, the only people allowed on Indian flights are Singaporean citizens and PRs, who are going to get tested and have to spend 21 days in isolation.""

cal interventions (NPIs) work?

On the contrary, according to pandemic data and analysis, none of these measures were recommended in our pre-covid era of pandemic preparedness SOP for respiratory diseases but they were found to be ineffective and still rings true today. What has changed?

Corrupted and junk science has creeped in and politicians all over the world wants to be seen to be doing something but most of these measures have little to no bearings on the general trajectory of the pandemic.

Watch the truth here advocated by tens of thousands of world-renowned scientists, medical professionals and epidemiologists
.

People of Singapore have to start waking up and question the Singapore government using junk science NPIs to hold the public accountable for any clusters.

What the world needs to do is focused protection, not “shut the whole world” hysterical strategy which does more harm than good.

1. Identify the high risk individuals (with hypertension, diabetes, etc) within the hospitals and care and nursing homes.

2. Assign staff who is regularly tested for covid to these high risk group (vaccinated staff does not cut it as vaccination does not prevent infection as shown in recent cases).

3. If you are a family member taking care of a vulnerable at home, you should go for regular testing as well.

This focused protection strategy is endorsed by tens of thousands of epidemiologists
, scientists and medical professionals.

This strategy is much better than wasting time and resources on testing and restricting the healthy general public (which has 99.99% chance of survival) which has little to no impact on the vulnerable.

I am getting conflicting information from everyone because no one is clear on this.

It is ok for there to be restrictions, but perhaps, more thought could be given to the implementation.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

Each and every organ in our body is already very weakened and severely underperforming
due to the contaminated air, food, water, mind, etc. as follows. So our bodies are the ideal places for any virus or disease to easily finish whatever meager health is remaining in our bodies and thus kill us within no time. But still we don't want to give up the below 7 killers of ours. We are just trying to patch up the symptoms when it is already too late while totally ignoring the following root causes of it all.

1. So much pollution in the air which we take in into our lungs every single day in massive proportions.

2. All the pesticides and other dosha-imbalanci
ng items in our food which are eating us up from within day after day.

3. All the artificial and poisonous chemical medicines, drugs, steroids, opioids, etc. which we have dumped into our bodies for decades and thus totally destroyed our own immune system and resistance power totally.

4. All the carcinogenic electromanetic,
radio frequency, etc. radiations and the mental junk and fantasies which all our bodily organs and mind are being constantly microwaved with in this technological age.

5. Mass-scale hatred and violence being inflicted on each other at the drop of the hat.

6. Nature's fury in the name of natural calamities because we are so cruelly exploiting nature to the very hilt for our own greedy and selfish ends.

7, And finally our toxic lust which we indulge in regularly causing the colossal loss and depletion of our seventh dhatu, the very essence of all what we eat, drink, and breathe. This renders all our other 6 dhatus (plasma, blood, muscle, adipose, bones, and marrow) weak and our immune system extremely susceptible to the slightest disease. The animals which engage in the most lust have the shortest lifespans and those who engage the least in lust have the longest lifespans. patanam bindu maranat, rakshanam bindu jivanat.

At that point, HBL, Work from home, MOH coming to pick up suspected cases and sending to hotels for quarantines and such, none of this will remain sustainable or effective.

period, they were also allowed to order food from grab or consume the food and drinks sent by their relatives/ friends to the hospital.

- As Covid-19 becomes endemic around the world, the focus in Singapore will shift away from how many cases there are each day, and more to the clinical condition of these cases.
Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Thursday (June 10) said in such a scenario, ""it's no longer about going after each and every infected case"".
He explained that even if a person were to be infected despite being vaccinated, the infection will likely be very mild or even asymptomatic.

""So we will need a different protocol for such cases,"" said Mr Wong at a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, which he co-chairs.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, his fellow co-chair, said such a shift is already happening, with the authorities looking at the clinical condition of people who are infected here.
This means, for instance, examining how many people need oxygen due to the severity of their condition, and how many are in the intensive care unit.

The ministers were responding to a question about Singapore's Covid-19 strategy in the long-term, when the virus is endemic - meaning it has settled in a certain population in a geographical region, and continues to persist. Some examples of endemic diseases here include influenza, dengue, and hand, foot and mouth disease.","Didnt they say that way fwd is to focus not on numbers but clinical state of those infected, are they on oxygen support or asymptomatic? - As Covid-19 becomes endemic around the world, the focus in Singapore will shift away from how many cases there are each day, and more to the clinical condition of these cases.

Why does Housing Development Board Build-to-Order Housing sales not allow internet banking payments for Build-to-Order Housing flats?  They tell me that the ONLY mode of payment is via Cashier’s Order.  They are mandating that I queue at the bank, for who knows how long, to buy a cashier’s order during this precarious Covid-19 pandemic.  Is Housing Development Board too irresponsible? I have their correspondence as proof.  Why can’t Housing Development Board Build-to-Order Housing Sales allow us to pay via internet banking like PayNow since their website states that this service is available for other services?  Would it not be safer than insisting I queue at the bank to purchase a cashier’s order.  Why is Housing Development Board so uncaring? Do they not understand the severity of this pandemic? With their reckless attitude, is it any wonder why we are seeing more community cases?  Is Housing Development Board undermining the government’s efforts to control Covid-19? Do we need another Circuit Breaker for them to take this seriously?  Mr.. Wong, I plead with you to please look into this matter urgently to better control the spread of Covid-19.

Dining at eateries seems more controlled and hygienic then eating at common spaces (eg.

Although there are also regulations in the common spaces supposed to be enforced by the Town Council, but things like people leaving their leftovers and trash all over still happens very frequently.

Follow Switzerland: Mask only in buildings, public transport and enclosed areas. Dining no limit. Basic hygiene: Hand sanitiser at all shops, restaurants etc. They even put small hand sanitisers at dining tables of a snack bar I went to last Sunday.
The idea is to let the citizens lead a new normal life as soon as possible for the mental and physical well-being of all, to prevent family quarrels, kids sibling quarrels, family break-ups when people are stuck at home; businesses going bankrupt, financial problems etc etc.
The costs are outweighing the benefits in SG and must be correct asap!

To materialistic doctors, will be entrusted with the task of removing the soul of humanity.

He would be extremely smart, but he would not develop a conscience, and that is the true goal of some materialistic circles.
With such a vaccine, you can easily make the etheric body loose in the physical body. Once the etheric body is detached, the relationship between the universe and the etheric body would become extremely unstable, and man would become an automaton, for the physical body of man must be polished on this Earth by spiritual will.

The answer on 23 August 2021: the Medium+ Mass Vaccinated Singapore is in a new deadly covid wave during the viral low season with 17 deaths versus zero than the same period (August) previous year without mass vaccination. See links at the end of this comment.

The above observation, the exacerbation of the covid pandemic after specific antibody mass vaccination, was and is scientifically the most plausible expected scenario as a result of this mass vaccination. Consequently, this science and the above observation is evidence of a serious violation, among many other serious violations (for example for young healthy people see the end of this comment), of among others the following two rules of the Nuremberg Code:
""
The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.

The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation
and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.

1. According to my insights high transmissibilit
y and of course “It has features that enable escape from the immune system” of the Delta variant are important signs of a serious and dangerous viral immune escape variant driven by specific antibody mass vaccination and by lockdowns! See article links below.

2. Where in the mainstream media are the figures about deaths / cases for fully vaccinated people with maximum antibody level (> 2 weeks after the last dose) in comparison with other groups (unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, …)? I've seen news that the death percentage for the maximum antibody level group would be 6 fold that of the other groups and that antibodies from covid vaccines are less neutralising for the delta variant. See article links below, page 12 of the second link and the first image further down. Is there an increased risk for ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) and antibody mediated enhancement of the disease with this delta and derived variants?
""

Now with appendix A: Articles about and images from mass vaccinated countries with:
– recent surges: viral immune escape and potentially antibody dependent and/or mediated enhancement (these are strong and dangerous worsenings of the disease) variants driven by the specific antibody mass vaccination? What about fully vaccinated people getting infected and dying with the Delta and derived variants with an apparently 6 fold death rate? and
– lockdowns
Mongolia, Seychelles, Bahrain and many more countries to be added to appendix A and with worldwide vaccination and covid situation maps.

I think we all have enough of non-sense. I presume the peak could only be flattened either many people get or very strict measures being implemented. Haizzz",0.6636,0.1450

The 1st stabilisation phase is a nice way to tell us it’s a failure. The 2nd extension is telling us it’s still is a failure.

Failure of endemic conditions precedent:
1. Rt value too high.
2. Number of discharge < daily infections

Removal of tracking “linked” and “unlinked” cases and dependent only on vaccinations
