All other flights to Singapore are bringing onboard CITIZENS and PERMANENT RESIDENTS, as well as approved work pass holders employed in Singapore. NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED - and it has been the law for OVER A YEAR.

And all of them have to get tested upon arrival and serve a Stay at Home Notice of 7 to 21 days depending on the origin country of their departure (it's the latter for anybody with history of travel to India) - and then have to get tested again before their quarantine ends.

Singapore has instituted extremely strict filtering rules that bar most of the travelers from coming in, while placing multiple conditions on everybody else, so that the virus is not transmitted into the community.

In addition it suspended entry of all non-resident pass holders coming from India, even if approval was issued beforehand - TEN DAYS AGO. Seriously...

So, as we speak, the only people allowed on Indian flights are Singaporean citizens and PRs, who are going to get tested and have to spend 21 days in isolation.""

cal interventions (NPIs) work?

On the contrary, according to pandemic data and analysis, none of these measures were recommended in our pre-covid era of pandemic preparedness SOP for respiratory diseases but they were found to be ineffective and still rings true today. What has changed?

Corrupted and junk science has creeped in and politicians all over the world wants to be seen to be doing something but most of these measures have little to no bearings on the general trajectory of the pandemic.

Watch the truth here advocated by tens of thousands of world-renowned scientists, medical professionals and epidemiologists
.

People of Singapore have to start waking up and question the Singapore government using junk science NPIs to hold the public accountable for any clusters.

What the world needs to do is focused protection, not “shut the whole world” hysterical strategy which does more harm than good.

1. Identify the high risk individuals (with hypertension, diabetes, etc) within the hospitals and care and nursing homes.

2. Assign staff who is regularly tested for covid to these high risk group (vaccinated staff does not cut it as vaccination does not prevent infection as shown in recent cases).

3. If you are a family member taking care of a vulnerable at home, you should go for regular testing as well.

This focused protection strategy is endorsed by tens of thousands of epidemiologists
, scientists and medical professionals.

This strategy is much better than wasting time and resources on testing and restricting the healthy general public (which has 99.99% chance of survival) which has little to no impact on the vulnerable.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

I have 5 staffs working in my Bangkok food house and all of them were infected to covid 2 months ago. They were being sent by the ambulance to the nearby 3 different hospital for 14 days quarantine ( 2+2+1) and luckily there were all okay and was out from the hospital on the 15th day after the swab result came out negative. When I asked them what kind of treatment was given during their 14 days stay in hospital, they told me they were given paracetamol and oxygen to breath on the first few days until the fever drop down then they stop taking paracetamol. Eventually they were just stay put in their bed for the rest of the quarantine period. During the hospitalisation
period, they were also allowed to order food from grab or consume the food and drinks sent by their relatives/ friends to the hospital.

When I asked them how they felt during the hospitalisation
period, amazingly they told me this is just a normal flu but takes alittle more time to heal compared to the normal fever or flu like symptoms they have previously before this covid thing came out on 2019.
They are now strong as before and continue working as normally.

The doctors has also given them a piece of good advice : to ensure good personal hygiene is the key to prevent from getting flu like infection.","It has already been known that this covid is not gonna end up totally and it will continue to stay on.

- As Covid-19 becomes endemic around the world, the focus in Singapore will shift away from how many cases there are each day, and more to the clinical condition of these cases.
Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Thursday (June 10) said in such a scenario, ""it's no longer about going after each and every infected case"".
He explained that even if a person were to be infected despite being vaccinated, the infection will likely be very mild or even asymptomatic.

""So we will need a different protocol for such cases,"" said Mr Wong at a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, which he co-chairs.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, his fellow co-chair, said such a shift is already happening, with the authorities looking at the clinical condition of people who are infected here.
This means, for instance, examining how many people need oxygen due to the severity of their condition, and how many are in the intensive care unit.

The ministers were responding to a question about Singapore's Covid-19 strategy in the long-term, when the virus is endemic - meaning it has settled in a certain population in a geographical region, and continues to persist. Some examples of endemic diseases here include influenza, dengue, and hand, foot and mouth disease.","Didnt they say that way fwd is to focus not on numbers but clinical state of those infected, are they on oxygen support or asymptomatic?

What are the chances of companies employing back 100 staff if they realize they could make do with 20 staff during the pandemic and continue to squeeze these 20 staff thereafter ?? Bigger countries can clamp up whenever they want to, because their lands are big enough for people to dig sweet potatoes in front of their house. I open my door only got concrete floor, how to dig? Make vaccination mandatory for all, no choosing of Vaccination, and have those who cannot take the vaccine do regular weekly swab. Open economy with closed borders, and have every incoming travellers vaccinated (including malaysia delivery drivers) if they havent already done so in their country. By the way, pandemic is no excuse for lacking in job creation.",-0.6901,-0.02143393393393393

The answer on 23 August 2021: the Medium+ Mass Vaccinated Singapore is in a new deadly covid wave during the viral low season with 17 deaths versus zero than the same period (August) previous year without mass vaccination. See links at the end of this comment.

The above observation, the exacerbation of the covid pandemic after specific antibody mass vaccination, was and is scientifically the most plausible expected scenario as a result of this mass vaccination. Consequently, this science and the above observation is evidence of a serious violation, among many other serious violations (for example for young healthy people see the end of this comment), of among others the following two rules of the Nuremberg Code:
""
The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.

The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation
and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.

2. Where in the mainstream media are the figures about deaths / cases for fully vaccinated people with maximum antibody level (> 2 weeks after the last dose) in comparison with other groups (unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, …)? I've seen news that the death percentage for the maximum antibody level group would be 6 fold that of the other groups and that antibodies from covid vaccines are less neutralising for the delta variant.

The latter increase results in high reported adverse effect probabilities and death probabilities after covid vaccination that are for the young extremely higher than the death probability after about one year of covid:

page=1","Is the Medium+ Mass Vaccinated Singapore (120 doses / 100 people, 49% two doses, 73% one dose - 24 July 2021) heading for a new covid wave and lockdown during the viral low season? Will a significant increase in number of deaths and admittances to hospitals, Intensive Care Unit's and on ventilators follow in line with the significant increase in reported active cases? Should it thus be added to the appendix A below or not?  The answer on 23 August 2021: the Medium+ Mass Vaccinated Singapore is in a new deadly covid wave during the viral low season with 17 deaths versus zero than the same period (August) previous year without mass vaccination. See links at the end of this comment.  The above observation, the exacerbation of the covid pandemic after specific antibody mass vaccination, was and is scientifically the most plausible expected scenario as a result of this mass vaccination. Consequently, this science and the above observation is evidence of a serious violation, among many other serious violations (for example for young healthy people see the end of this comment), of among others the following two rules of the Nuremberg Code: "" The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.  The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment. "" See links at the end of this comment. And now they also have plans and already effective implementations (seen worldwide) to mandate besides luring and forcing the covid mass vaccination!  "" 1. According to my insights high transmissibilit y and of course “It has features that enable escape from the immune system” of the Delta variant are important signs of a serious and dangerous viral immune escape variant driven by specific antibody mass vaccination and by lockdowns! See article links below.  2. Where in the mainstream media are the figures about deaths / cases for fully vaccinated people with maximum antibody level (> 2 weeks after the last dose) in comparison with other groups (unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, …)? I've seen news that the death percentage for the maximum antibody level group would be 6 fold that of the other groups and that antibodies from covid vaccines are less neutralising for the delta variant. See article links below, page 12 of the second link and the first image further down. Is there an increased risk for ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) and antibody mediated enhancement of the disease with this delta and derived variants? ""  Now with appendix A: Articles about and images from mass vaccinated countries with: – recent surges: viral immune escape and potentially antibody dependent and/or mediated enhancement (these are strong and dangerous worsenings of the disease) variants driven by the specific antibody mass vaccination? What about fully vaccinated people getting infected and dying with the Delta and derived variants with an apparently 6 fold death rate? and – lockdowns Mongolia, Seychelles, Bahrain and many more countries to be added to appendix A and with worldwide vaccination and covid situation maps.  @CNN To end this pandemic, 'we've got to get everyone in our country vaccinated,' US surgeon general says Top criticizing and/or clarifying comments, links and images of the above CNN main article follow further down after the links to the main article.  www.tumia.org/ en/directory/en/ instance.php?tin ame=%40CNN+To+e nd+this+pandemi c%2C+weve+got+t o+get+everyone+ in+our+country+ vaccinated%2C+YOU S+surgeon+gener al&relationship =All&drsid=0&pi sid=0&page=1  Data and other links:  www.worldometers .info/ coronavirus/ country/ singapore/  ly   interactive/ 2021/world/ covid-vaccinatio national service-tracker.html   en.wikipedia.org /wiki/ Nuremberg_Code  The latter increase results in high reported adverse effect probabilities and death probabilities after covid vaccination that are for the young extremely higher than the death probability after about one year of covid:  www.tumia.org/ en/directory/en/ instance.php?tin ame=%40ArchiveO rg+Frontline+Wo rkers+Testimoni es+and+VAERs+Co vid+Vaccination +Adverse+Events +–+March+2021&r elationship=All &drsid=0&pisid= 0&tiname_dno=1& page=1",-0.5919,0.0627940947940948

Israel DOES NOT use China vaccines at all,
but Israel uses only Moderna+Pfizzer
vaccines, and that is why Israel has record number of daily cases now, and the number of daily cases in Israel is now higher than before vaccination started, and the vast majority of Israel people have already been vaccinated .

The reason for the failure to stop virus spread in Israel and also in Singapore,
is because Moderna+Pfizzer
vaccines, are NOT EFFECTIVE against the delta variant, and the effectiveness will keep dropping every month.
