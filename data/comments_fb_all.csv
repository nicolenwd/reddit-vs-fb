All other flights to Singapore are bringing onboard CITIZENS and PERMANENT RESIDENTS, as well as approved work pass holders employed in Singapore. NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED - and it has been the law for OVER A YEAR.

And all of them have to get tested upon arrival and serve a Stay at Home Notice of 7 to 21 days depending on the origin country of their departure (it's the latter for anybody with history of travel to India) - and then have to get tested again before their quarantine ends.

Singapore has instituted extremely strict filtering rules that bar most of the travelers from coming in, while placing multiple conditions on everybody else, so that the virus is not transmitted into the community.

In addition it suspended entry of all non-resident pass holders coming from India, even if approval was issued beforehand - TEN DAYS AGO. Seriously...

So, as we speak, the only people allowed on Indian flights are Singaporean citizens and PRs, who are going to get tested and have to spend 21 days in isolation.""

721,10158274256907934,Singapore government are too complacent. They start to bar visitors only when cases start arising. We can’t blame the infected ones instead we blame those who allow to let them in. And now the government are blaming locals for not abiding the rules.. when they are the one making those poor choices. Can’t complain much because 61% voted for the PAP. So this is the consequences. But where is the leadership of the PAP?? The promises they made during the general election???,2021-05-04 06:58:10

On the contrary, according to pandemic data and analysis, none of these measures were recommended in our pre-covid era of pandemic preparedness SOP for respiratory diseases but they were found to be ineffective and still rings true today. What has changed?

Corrupted and junk science has creeped in and politicians all over the world wants to be seen to be doing something but most of these measures have little to no bearings on the general trajectory of the pandemic.

Watch the truth here advocated by tens of thousands of world-renowned scientists, medical professionals and epidemiologists
.

People of Singapore have to start waking up and question the Singapore government using junk science NPIs to hold the public accountable for any clusters.

What the world needs to do is focused protection, not “shut the whole world” hysterical strategy which does more harm than good.

1. Identify the high risk individuals (with hypertension, diabetes, etc) within the hospitals and care and nursing homes.

2. Assign staff who is regularly tested for covid to these high risk group (vaccinated staff does not cut it as vaccination does not prevent infection as shown in recent cases).

3. If you are a family member taking care of a vulnerable at home, you should go for regular testing as well.

This focused protection strategy is endorsed by tens of thousands of epidemiologists
, scientists and medical professionals.

This strategy is much better than wasting time and resources on testing and restricting the healthy general public (which has 99.99% chance of survival) which has little to no impact on the vulnerable.

Another example - can a family go somewhere in a car together? Again, if I drop my kids off at school, do I have to drive them there one by one so we will be in pairs at all times?

I am getting conflicting information from everyone because no one is clear on this.

It is ok for there to be restrictions, but perhaps, more thought could be given to the implementation.
How would a single parent with more than one child then manage? Should one child be left home unsupervised so they can be in “groups of 2”?

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

https://

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later.",2021-05-14 01:06:20

These kids are our future. If they go down, there’ll be no future for our country.

May I suggest an islandwide circuit breaker for all students temporarily; for schools, tuition and enrichment centres, till we are cleared of this new variant, or till everyone is vaccinated. Education can still continue through online classes.

If it worsens, we can consider an islandwide circuit breaker for adults too.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

3. All the artificial and poisonous chemical medicines, drugs, steroids, opioids, etc. which we have dumped into our bodies for decades and thus totally destroyed our own immune system and resistance power totally.

4. All the carcinogenic electromanetic,
radio frequency, etc. radiations and the mental junk and fantasies which all our bodily organs and mind are being constantly microwaved with in this technological age.

5. Mass-scale hatred and violence being inflicted on each other at the drop of the hat.

6. Nature's fury in the name of natural calamities because we are so cruelly exploiting nature to the very hilt for our own greedy and selfish ends.

7, And finally our toxic lust which we indulge in regularly causing the colossal loss and depletion of our seventh dhatu, the very essence of all what we eat, drink, and breathe. This renders all our other 6 dhatus (plasma, blood, muscle, adipose, bones, and marrow) weak and our immune system extremely susceptible to the slightest disease. The animals which engage in the most lust have the shortest lifespans and those who engage the least in lust have the longest lifespans. patanam bindu maranat, rakshanam bindu jivanat.

These 7 are the precise reasons why Srimad Bhagavatam states that people will literally become like dwarfs in primitive villages massacred by their cruel monarchical rulers and eventually live only for a maximum of 15 years as Kaliyuga progresses and ends after 427,000 years. kamala jala dala, jivana talamala, chapala sukha laba lagi re...",2021-05-14 01:07:07

[The restriction does not apply to passengers from the same household. For example, a parent can travel with his or her two children if they live together, LTA said.]

{We recognise that there may be occasions where members of the same household may need to move about in groups larger than two persons, especially those with young children or elderly parents in order to look after their higher care needs. These may include taking public transport, going for medical appointments, attending classes or going to work in the same vehicle. We are prepared to be flexible in our implementation of the general rule for such bonafide cases.

2280,10158300719912934,"Partial closures, moving to HBL, Work from home and all sorts of requirements do nothing but complicate daily lives and activities. There is a need for us to be proactive rather than being reactive. All these temporary measures might help in the short term but learning from our past migrant worker dormitory outbreak experience, I find there is an urgent need to shutdown completely for 2-3 weeks. We have to do this now before the case numbers spike in hundreds. At that point, HBL, Work from home, MOH coming to pick up suspected cases and sending to hotels for quarantines and such, none of this will remain sustainable or effective. Closures of course will call for government support which seems to be lacking with current measures. All businesses will suffer during this time. I believe people will accept closing down for 2-3 weeks completely and receive some form of government support to tide over this period rather than staying open but with a list of things “not to do” and take another deep financial hit. We can use this 2-3 weeks of closure to create a world record of fastest vaccination drive in a country. Vaccinate every single one. May be.

These young ones are told that they can’t sing songs and play together with others... have you interacted with kids below 6yo? 🤦🏻‍♀️

Most childcare centres are pretty small. When they eat or during routine time, their masks are off and they’d definitely talk to each other.

Many preschoolers have older siblings in primary or secondary school.
I’m very worried that there’d be an outbreak in preschools coz can u imagine what these kiddos will be going through?

They were being sent by the ambulance to the nearby 3 different hospital for 14 days quarantine ( 2+2+1) and luckily there were all okay and was out from the hospital on the 15th day after the swab result came out negative. When I asked them what kind of treatment was given during their 14 days stay in hospital, they told me they were given paracetamol and oxygen to breath on the first few days until the fever drop down then they stop taking paracetamol. Eventually they were just stay put in their bed for the rest of the quarantine period. During the hospitalisation
period, they were also allowed to order food from grab or consume the food and drinks sent by their relatives/ friends to the hospital.

When I asked them how they felt during the hospitalisation
period, amazingly they told me this is just a normal flu but takes alittle more time to heal compared to the normal fever or flu like symptoms they have previously before this covid thing came out on 2019.

3003,10158367205697934,"Didnt they say that way fwd is to focus not on numbers but clinical state of those infected, are they on oxygen support or asymptomatic?
- As Covid-19 becomes endemic around the world, the focus in Singapore will shift away from how many cases there are each day, and more to the clinical condition of these cases.
Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Thursday (June 10) said in such a scenario, ""it's no longer about going after each and every infected case"".
He explained that even if a person were to be infected despite being vaccinated, the infection will likely be very mild or even asymptomatic.

""So we will need a different protocol for such cases,"" said Mr Wong at a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, which he co-chairs.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, his fellow co-chair, said such a shift is already happening, with the authorities looking at the clinical condition of people who are infected here.
This means, for instance, examining how many people need oxygen due to the severity of their condition, and how many are in the intensive care unit.

The ministers were responding to a question about Singapore's Covid-19 strategy in the long-term, when the virus is endemic - meaning it has settled in a certain population in a geographical region, and continues to persist. Some examples of endemic diseases here include influenza, dengue, and hand, foot and mouth disease.",2021-06-16 04:33:19

What does that mean? it is not the location but the control of asymptomatic cases. It has been unfair to point infection numbers at shopping malls, supermarkets, fnb outlets just because it is mandatory for them to have the grey tracetogether scanner installed. Many private clinics dont even have the grey TT scanner and reception clerks just ""let go"" if difficult patients refuse to scan tt code. Long bus and mrt rides can also be point of spread, but the problem is neglected. I dont think your underlings have been giving you the reports necessary for useful evaluation. Separately, get the data from MOM - how many aunties and uncles above age 50 are working in FnB? Once they are retrenched, they will highly not able to get back the same job even when economy reopens. Companies would rather employ young jobless ones first. The impact of restrictions on FnB extends much further beyond hawkers closing down.
Many suppliers to fastfood chains have also shrunk in size massively and move out of Raffles Place, cutting manpower in accounting, marketing, sales etc. What are the chances of companies employing back 100 staff if they realize they could make do with 20 staff during the pandemic and continue to squeeze these 20 staff thereafter ?? Bigger countries can clamp up whenever they want to, because their lands are big enough for people to dig sweet potatoes in front of their house. I open my door only got concrete floor, how to dig? Make vaccination mandatory for all, no choosing of vaxx, and have those who cannot take the vax do regular weekly swab.

Public toilets could be a source of transmission and there are repeated instance that our cleaners are always the ones that gets infected first in major clusters.
We have to care for them and ensure that they are well protected. It’s an occupational hazard now.
They need to be provided with face shield and proper masks. They also need to be reminded that mask must be changed after every round of cleaning.
PPE could be provided too but to some, this might seems like it’s overly cautious. When water are sprayed for cleaning, tiny droplets are formed and this might be a problem.
The whole public toilet cleaning, table cleaning, dish washing, stall cleaning, SOPs needs further examination and enhancements.
Please also do not pin the blame on cleaners, hawkers too and the point is, they need to be protected. I think a whole set of safety measures could also prevent more clusters from forming.

They tell me that the ONLY mode of payment is via Cashier’s Order.

They are mandating that I queue at the bank, for who knows how long, to buy a cashier’s order during this precarious Covid-19 pandemic.

Is HDB too irresponsible? I have their correspondence as proof.

Why can’t HDB BTO Sales allow us to pay via internet banking like PayNow since their website states that this service is available for other services?

Would it not be safer than insisting I queue at the bank to purchase a cashier’s order.

Why is HDB so uncaring? Do they not understand the severity of this pandemic? With their reckless attitude, is it any wonder why we are seeing more community cases?

Is HDB undermining the government’s efforts to control Covid-19? Do we need another Circuit Breaker for them to take this seriously?

Dining at eateries seems more controlled and hygienic then eating at common spaces (eg.

Although there are also regulations in the common spaces supposed to be enforced by the Town Council, but things like people leaving their leftovers and trash all over still happens very frequently.

Personally, if you want to disallow eating at eateries, then include common spaces as well.

3244,10158367164542934,"Now that the COVID-19 test kits are sold in the open market for $10 to $13, the government can encourage people to buy and do self testing by offering free swabbing service at all clinics and reimburse the clinics for the swabbing services. The consumer pays only for the kits.

Assuming the pharmacy has a 50% profit margin on selling the test kits, then the clinics can offer the test kits with free swabbing services.

I believe there is a market for swabbing services but the consumer pays for the test kits.

In short, all pharmacies selling the kit at $12 earns a $6 profit. But the clinics can offer the testing services and earn the $6 instead. Otherwise levy a service charge for swabbing.",2021-06-16 04:33:19

Scientific research has shown that even Vaccinated person can still get infected with Covid.

Do you think that this policy is going to create divide and xenophobic within the community?

Similarly to the policy of MRNA technology Vaccines vs inactivated Virus Technology Vaccines. 🤦‍♂️

If a vaccine is indeed unsafe, do you think the health authority will still allow the jabs at private clinics?

Simply Discriminating…

There are bound to have people within the Community with various reasons for not being vaccinated. Eg: allergy, health reason, etc
Are we going to discriminate these people for being unvaccinated or taking inactivated technology vaccine?

Study or work too much until dont know how our immune system works?
Millions around the world have already recovered. Why so scared until like that? If you are not vaccinated but have sufficient sleep supported by supplements, your body will produce antibodies to fight wat .. Dont know this simple basic concept meh? Just don’t let it be severe case then long Covid will not happen. (Sufficient sleep will produce sufficient immune cells that will kill Covid n other viruses, bacterias etc upon their entry so that they do not have a chance to multiply and circulate in our bloodstream and reach other organs.)

Follow Switzerland: Mask only in buildings, public transport and enclosed areas. Dining no limit. Basic hygiene: Hand sanitiser at all shops, restaurants etc. They even put small hand sanitisers at dining tables of a snack bar I went to last Sunday.
The idea is to let the citizens lead a new normal life as soon as possible for the mental and physical well-being of all, to prevent family quarrels, kids sibling quarrels, family break-ups when people are stuck at home; businesses going bankrupt, financial problems etc etc.
The costs are outweighing the benefits in SG and must be correct asap!

My 6.5 yr old triplets hvg been asking to go to SG to see their grandparents (my parents). How to go? Quarantine will cost our family of 5 a bomb! Switzerland doesnt even hv any quarantine if you pass the PCR test upon entry! Follow Switzerland leh .. I want to go back to SG to see my parents and simply enjoy SG again.

4140,10158031423322115,"More than a hundred years ago, Rudolf Steiner wrote the following:

” In the future, we will eliminate the soul with medicine. Under the pretext of a ‘healthy point of view’, there will be a vaccine by which the human body will be treated as soon as possible directly at birth, so that the human being cannot develop the thought of the existence of soul and Spirit.
To materialistic doctors, will be entrusted with the task of removing the soul of humanity. As today, people are vaccine against this disease or disease, so in the future, children will be vaccinated with a substance that can be produced precisely in such a way that people, thanks to this vaccination, will be immune to being subjected to the “madness” of spiritual life. He would be extremely smart, but he would not develop a conscience, and that is the true goal of some materialistic circles.
With such a vaccine, you can easily make the etheric body loose in the physical body. Once the etheric body is detached, the relationship between the universe and the etheric body would become extremely unstable, and man would become an automaton, for the physical body of man must be polished on this Earth by spiritual will. So, the vaccine becomes a kind of arymanique force; man can no longer get rid of a given materialistic feeling. He becomes materialistic of constitution and can no longer rise to the spiritual “.

""....antibodies
can aggravate rather than mitigate disease. This occurs because certain cells of the immune system take up antibody-tagged
microbes and destroy them. If a virus particle to which antibodies have bound is taken up by such a cell, but it then manages to evade destruction, it may instead start to multiply within the cell. Overall, the antibody will then have enhanced the replication of the virus. Clinically, this antibody-depend
ent enhancement (ADE) can cause a hyperinflammato
ry response (a “cytokine storm”) that will amplify the damage to the lungs, liver and other organs of our body."" ....D4CE

So which is riskier ....catching covid naturally or getting vaccinated ?

And which group causes more problems (eg vaccine induced/
enhanced infections, vaccine breakthrough infections, vaccine enhanced transmissions, vaccine prolonged disease, vaccine induced/
enhanced mutations etc) for all ....the vaccinated or the unvaccinated ?

So who's misleading whom and are people being told the truth? That is the question ....

Where the benefits of covid vaccinations are still questionable and where there are severe risks including death from these unapproved highly questionable vaccines, there must be individual choice and it is wrong, unethical and unconstitutiona

Then only will we see containment. A syring decisive resolve instead of doing the cha cha with measures.

4540,10158110824057115,"""Rely on vaccination"" 🤣🤣

Rely on something unreliable?

When it doesn't stop transmission at all (vaccinated infection rate exceeded vaccinated population ratio of 80% already), and serious illness in the vaccinated has already started climbing (around 50% of those requiring oxygen support are vaccinated)?

Better start worrying now before you realize the vaccine doesn't protect you at all.

5112,563818448000991,"Is the Medium+ Mass Vaccinated Singapore (120 doses / 100 people, 49% two doses, 73% one dose - 24 July 2021) heading for a new covid wave and lockdown during the viral low season? Will a significant increase in number of deaths and admittances to hospitals, ICU's and on ventilators follow in line with the significant increase in reported active cases? Should it thus be added to the appendix A below or not?

The answer on 23 August 2021: the Medium+ Mass Vaccinated Singapore is in a new deadly covid wave during the viral low season with 17 deaths versus zero than the same period (August) previous year without mass vaccination. See links at the end of this comment.

The above observation, the exacerbation of the covid pandemic after specific antibody mass vaccination, was and is scientifically the most plausible expected scenario as a result of this mass vaccination. Consequently, this science and the above observation is evidence of a serious violation, among many other serious violations (for example for young healthy people see the end of this comment), of among others the following two rules of the Nuremberg Code:
""
The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.

The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation
and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.
""
See links at the end of this comment. And now they also have plans and already effective implementations
(seen worldwide) to mandate besides luring and forcing the covid mass vaccination!

""
1. According to my insights high transmissibilit
y and of course “It has features that enable escape from the immune system” of the Delta variant are important signs of a serious and dangerous viral immune escape variant driven by specific antibody mass vaccination and by lockdowns! See article links below.

2. Where in the mainstream media are the figures about deaths / cases for fully vaccinated people with maximum antibody level (> 2 weeks after the last dose) in comparison with other groups (unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, …)? I've seen news that the death percentage for the maximum antibody level group would be 6 fold that of the other groups and that antibodies from covid vaccines are less neutralising for the delta variant. See article links below, page 12 of the second link and the first image further down. Is there an increased risk for ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) and antibody mediated enhancement of the disease with this delta and derived variants?
""

Now with appendix A: Articles about and images from mass vaccinated countries with:
– recent surges: viral immune escape and potentially antibody dependent and/or mediated enhancement (these are strong and dangerous worsenings of the disease) variants driven by the specific antibody mass vaccination? What about fully vaccinated people getting infected and dying with the Delta and derived variants with an apparently 6 fold death rate? and
– lockdowns
Mongolia, Seychelles, Bahrain and many more countries to be added to appendix A and with worldwide vaccination and covid situation maps.

Israel DOES NOT use China vaccines at all,
but Israel uses only Moderna+Pfizzer
vaccines, and that is why Israel has record number of daily cases now, and the number of daily cases in Israel is now higher than before vaccination started, and the vast majority of Israel people have already been vaccinated .

The reason for the failure to stop virus spread in Israel and also in Singapore,
is because Moderna+Pfizzer
vaccines, are NOT EFFECTIVE against the delta variant, and the effectiveness will keep dropping every month.

Both Israel and Singapore made the same mistake, of naively and trusting in full, the USA fake news media claim, that wildly overstate the effectiveness of vaccines like Moderna+Pfizzer
vaccines, and the same USA fake news media FALSELY CLAIM that China vaccines are not effective, but in the real world, China vaccines turn out to be the most effective, especially against the Delta variant .

This is just a few days before the start of PSLE first paper. It is regrettable that my daughter will not be able to take her PSLE paper after so much preparation and adhere to going to school daily because MOE declared that it is very safe. She is emotionally affected after learning that she will not be able to go for the papers after a year long preparation. All her efforts practically went down the drain. In my opinion, this is how badly the covid situation is being managed in school by MOE and MOH. Her whole class was placed on LOA (pending QO). Why is it that they are not allowed to take the exam if they have no symptoms and tested negative? We can have various safe clearance options like ART on the spot or even PCR test. The children should still have the right to take examinations if they are fit to. They can be in isolated room as well but not deny them of their right to sit for the exam. If travellers are able to come into SG with just a PCR clearance test and need not serve QO, why can't the children take exam? I am very sure that my daughter is not the only one feeling disappointed and devastated that her efforts has gone to waste. We will appreciate of MOE and MOH can come up with better alternatives in handling this situation especially for graduating children. Please help them.

It is very immature to still insist on politics when lives are lost in double digits daily. And testing asymptomatic people in high numbers is not helping as America and other countries will follow suit to warn their people against travelling to sg.

Countries like HK have high population but they handled it better than you did because your biggest mistake was to continue to allow South Asians to visit sg on visitor passes and the short duration of the SHN has resulted in infections in malls etc and probably resulted in high infections in dorm now.

It is very simple, compare what you did and what countries who handle it better not do, then you will get the clear answers on what went wrong. It is time to eat the humble pie.

The 1st stabilisation phase is a nice way to tell us it’s a failure. The 2nd extension is telling us it’s still is a failure.

Failure of endemic conditions precedent:
1. Rt value too high.
2. Number of discharge < daily infections
3. Infection rates increasing exponentially
4. Country ability to cope with virus not yet sufficient

Experts wrong. Decisions base on experts not correct so far

Implications
1. Economy more affected than July
2. More People continue getting covid
3. More Deaths

Likely reasons
Removal of tracking “linked” and “unlinked” cases and dependent only on vaccinations

Stabilisation??

- The current trend is getting high from breaking record after record of more daily deaths, higher ICU, higher oxygen support, higher hospitalisation
numbers.
- ""Stabilisation""
continues these trends, if not let them worsen

Search the dictionary!
- ""Reflection"" Phase, ""Corrective"", ""Emergency"" etc. All fits reality much much closer

Not just a word
- Effectively, the name doesn't count
- But not when those highest up in the hierarchy always let investment in readiness fall short of necessary measures.
- Quit being sly by terming ""Stabilisation""
to buy insurance to own up to the responsibility expected from leadership

Make it your ""We'll stop fooling around with suicide"" Phase.

I sincerely hope cases will start to go down but government should be more practical instead of being hopeful.

Having said that, one may ask… what is being practical? Right now tighten got good, got bad. Loosen got good, got bad. Timing is critical. Long term planning is very difficult, but it’s important to get it right. Unfortunately, very very few to no examples of countries opening but no covid cases. The lack of isolation bed is the foremost problem to solve.

The 1st stabilisation phase is a nice way to tell us it’s a failure. The 2nd extension is telling us it’s still is a failure.

Failure of endemic conditions precedent:
1. Rt value too high.
2. Number of discharge < daily infections
3. Infection rates increasing exponentially
4. Country ability to cope with virus not yet sufficient

Experts wrong. Decisions base on experts not correct so far

Implications
1. Economy more affected than July
2. More People continue getting covid
3. More Deaths

Likely reasons
Removal of tracking “linked” and “unlinked” cases and dependent only on vaccinations
