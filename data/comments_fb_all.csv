0,10157877630867100,The opening up in early April was way too much/fast. 75% back to office is practically allowing for all to go back. When the borders were wide open to practically all. Too hasty.
1,10157877561317100,"Please ban India flights, India citizens India passport holders India born anyone with a travel history to India. Once you have this ban we will be like before zero community case. Other countries have imposed total ban on India flights and citizens including jail and fine. We should follow in order to protect our citizens."
2,10157877564117100,Haiz.. no apologies for importing cases. All your doing leh garmen. I'm going to have a friendly chat with my MP!
3,10157877557412100,Tighten local measures but fail to shut borders completely on travelers from high-risk countries. What's the point then? What a shame!
4,10157877555032100,Blaming us for not following safe distancing measures again instead of blaming themselves.
5,10157877610822100,Better to be safe than sorry. Stay safe. We cannot afford another circuit breaker. Do stay at home also.
6,10157877599182100,Better to be drastic and safe.. no point fighting it. Even with the vaccine 💉 we are not safe bec this thing is mutating faster than we can can develop the vaccine 😨 Stay safe everyone.
7,10157877637422100,It's ridiculous that the government is forcing pre-event testing on weddings scheduled this month with lesser than 100 people now with so little lead time left to prepare. Can't the government show more empathy and flexibility?
8,10157877794107100,"Well done for stricter measure, Should consider impose back team A and Team B rotation as well. Let's open up more after a good percentage has been vaccinated like 80 percent."
9,10157878077392100,"many sme offices long ago already ask all (100%) back to office...
many use tracetogether apps just to check in, then off the apps...how to do proper contact tracing...some using few phones with few names...some tokens already no blinking...some
use other persons' tokens...alread
y our contact tracing so efficient...do tokens and trace together apps communicate with each others...?"
10,10157877580587100,"Finally.. its glad to hear that the taskforce team are implementing more stringent measures. Sorry, folks. Think tts the best solution currently. Better be safe than sorry. Thank you for your understanding. we cant really afford another circuit breaker. What happens already happening. we hv to move on. Be alert, stay safe and minimise social gatherings for a period of time. If all of our hearts stay as one n wirk together as one, we can overcome it, must overcome it and WILL overcome it! Bcos we want our little island 🇸🇬to return to breath with clear air, beautiful sunshine city which the world envy. We can achieve it! ✊🏻✌🏻💪🏻❤️🦁 🇸🇬🙏🏻"
11,10157877554642100,"Just lockdown again lah, our stupid government is the one who opened the boarders and welcome foreigners to enter and now they push the blame to us locals. In the 1st place, do we really need so many new maids? Most of them that came in surely will bring the virus to our country 🤦‍♀️"
12,10157877547537100,Okay why not cut down flights from affected countries then ?
13,10157877584797100,"The signs are already there, yet they chose to wait and see. Again..."
14,10157877566167100,"Last year never react fast enough to close border with China, end up mass dormitory infection, Circuit Breaker, 4 Relief Budget. This year again repeating same with India ?"
15,10157877570957100,I believe we should institute some social distancing in public transportation too.
16,10157877565697100,My boss says he needs to see me in office then he knows I’m working. Is that valid reason for him?
17,10157877587987100,Why? Indian flight keep coming in.
18,10157877616172100,"Is the rule : no more than 50% of employees should be at the office at any one time ( meaning a company who has 100 employees total , can only have 50 on site ) ..

or is it : no more than 50% of employees who can work from home,can be at the office, at any one time ( meaning in the same 100 employee setting , if only 50 of them have the ability to work at home , 50% will be 25... so only 25 of these 50 people can come to office) ?"
19,10157877549642100,"This is shoddy thinking from 4G ministers at best - everyday change policies, flip prata without a clear cut goal.

You just look at how people are eating at restaurants - 30 to 45 mins with their masks off. If 1 unfortunate patron is there from the TTSH or ICA cluster (which I must say has spread quite widely), the whole restaurant will more or less kena."
20,10157877698862100,"Excessive to say the least…it’s really simple: if you don’t want to be infected, stay home. Vaccines are being distributed, wear your mask, limit contact, and be smart while continuing life. It really isn’t that difficult."
21,10157877602412100,"Just in time for Eid. Thanks to those who made this happened. Can't even do a simple handover of power to a new PM, you expect these people to know what is more important? Economy or people?"
22,10157877547502100,Then should stop all flights from the high infectious countries regardless of citizens or PRs from coming in.
23,10157877581372100,Whoever in charge please ownup and harakiri? Failed us singaporeans totally.... other countries voluntarily resign from their positions when they are taken to task..
24,10157877650672100,Last year we didn’t get to raya and this year u wanna do this . Trust us Only 1.5% of 100% people will listen to this .. even if u put 1000 ambassador around.
25,10157877572392100,We kena sacrificed because some people insist to let those people fly in! 🤬
26,10157877565187100,"How come so many people complaining about our own government? Without the FW who will be building the road, clear the rubbish, build houses and many more... Will you be the one? We are not back to ground zero yet but put those measures in place is to ensure the spread stops where it is right now before it gets worse. Please let our government do what they need to, as we people of this nation do our part by keeping those safe distancing and safe measures. If it says 5 means 5 in social gathering.. Not 5 here and 5 on the othet table.. If it says wear a mask and please wear it properly.. Not only covering your mouth.. These measures is also telling us that 'we are too complacent' already. Zero count it doesnt mean we have won the fight against covid19. Having vaccinated it doesn't mean you wont get infected and a mask is not required..."
27,10157877575547100,"Lax rules on outsiders for so long and in turn, we have to bear the tightened restrictions😒😒.. Bravo🙄"
28,10157878278157100,"To MOE

I urge the ministry to send a directive to schools and campuses, to advise all students to stop talking in trains and buses. In the NSL, everyday, I see these polytechnic students yak so loudly and non-stop among themselves. At least, MOE can help to target this big group of youngsters who are totally ignorant on the risk to spread the virus within an enclosed environment.

The four languages constant announcement, big signage affixed on the cabin panels, mrt staff carrying placard walking through the cabin asking commuters Not to talk, but is all USELESS !"
29,10157877543882100,"We citizens have to make so many compromises thanks to this incompetent govt!

Last year, they ignored the foreign worker dorms.

This year, they ignored calls to stop the boarders from reopening to those in high risk countries but they think they know best. Look what is happening now? We citizens have to bear the brunt of their foolishness again!"
30,10157877549862100,It's okay. We still can hari raya inside TRAIN!! 🤣🤣
31,10157877554737100,"The idea of opening the borders is to bring in the workers and help improve the economy.
But what is the economic and social cost of letting in the virus and having such controls?
Is it a case of costs outweigh the gains?"
32,10157877600827100,"Thanks for the refusal to ban flights from high risk countries earlier and now we have to celebrate Hari Raya under strict restrictions again.

TERIMA KASIH!"
33,10157877554982100,Sheng shiong staff: got chance big bonus again!
34,10157877597097100,"Seriously, govt took so long to close borders for short term nonessential travelers, and now all of us have to pay the price for this reluctance to impose travel restrictions! 😡"
35,10157877703842100,"In this scenarios, I would have to consider weighing the economic and spread of virus. Although it is not possible 100% to stop, I must at least slow down its transmissions."
36,10157877560382100,Incompetent gahmen.. all they think is how to boost economy and get back what they give.. now open borders covid come back.. kuang kuang kuang.. congrats
37,10157877635762100,"As a Malaysian, I think it's a wise decision..Just do it for 3 weeks lor no means become like Malaysia then susah.."
38,10157877575092100,I rather CB for 2 weeks now than CB 2 months or more if more cases arise
39,10157877543852100,Thanks ah gahmen. Another hari raya inside the mrt i guess
40,10157879365212100,How about Mrt and other public transport.
41,10157877545907100,MRT/BUS - 50% ? Please advise ….
42,10157877548557100,5 distinct visitors..?? Wow..! Raya is just around the corner..! Let's see after raya..! Will it be still 5 distinct visitors..??
43,10157877590892100,"Thank you very much for the restrictions again!
So tell us what you going to do with al the flights coming in from India and all the High risk countries?
We did our part, and we are tired of these obedience yet someone screwed up policies!"
44,10157877564977100,Testing balloon.Now burst.Citizens had to lockdown again soon.
45,10157877572797100,import to community cases. Good job well done 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
46,10157877627722100,"Not again. So my family of seven cannot visit my parents all at once, BUT, my parents can visit me and my family. The total number of people is the same either way, is it not?

Otak kambing is the person who came up with this regulation."
47,10157877552162100,Now become citizens fault again! U can bring forward all the stupid measures but cannot ban the flight from high risks countries earlier. What nonsense is this ? Are u trying to cover your guilt for the clusters?
48,10157877550397100,"Can bring back CB 2.0 better, people have gone through it and know what to expect. And they are ready too."
49,10157877566087100,Pls close the borders! As Singaporeans we are very obedient in doing what was told but if the government keep on opening up the borders to allow foreigners to come in then we are being persecuted with the tightening measures. It’s unfair to us totally!
50,10157877803087100,Many companies already reverted... this is a few days late
51,10157877599227100,It will never happen in some company.
52,10157877663722100,"Just when we thought things were looking up, and now Hari Raya has to be small group size again. 2 years already."
53,10157877730867100,"In the first place tackle the root cause!!
Never managed the root cause, no points of putting measures every now and then. Stupid stupid... stop the import cases."
54,10157877551152100,We’re supposed to understand what a big pow wow is supposed to mean 😂
55,10157877894227100,"This Covid, or sarcastically in our local Iban lingo in Sarawak, "" Kumbit"" , really punishes us all to no end!"
56,10157877826487100,"They just told us what to do and what not to do. Pervious lock down we have work together to bring down the infection.

They didn't tell us what is the caused of The spike but using excuse that we need Foreign workers here which I agree but they didn't told us the caused of the spike which we all believe it not cause by the FW.. We just want them to say it out!!"
57,10157879871747100,"My department need 100% to be back in office even I had gp letter she still want me to go back and mention gp letter cannot take into consideration, Gp not a doctor?"
58,10157877564542100,We have done OUR part! All 5 million of us.
59,10157879476942100,MOM should check all office at raffles place and shenton way also.
60,10157877549932100,Just live with it covit is here to stay a bit longer.
61,10157877680347100,"Ministry of Health, Singapore.
So how about Public Transport like Buses & Train? Where is the social distance measure?"
62,10157880210372100,Everything for Dim Sum in Kowloon.
63,10157877567282100,Never look back but we are now. Ideally it’s always move forward…
64,10157878097137100,Why dun quarantine those affected India at Istana
65,10157878928657100,"This is not phase 2. There is a distinct difference in phase 2 and current workplace requirements. Phase 2 requires individual who can wfh to spend 50% time wfh. Now dont have leh. Just 50% limit at workplace.

And wfh is still not default"
66,10157877550942100,Wonder what about MRT and Public Transport?
67,10157877746542100,It's akin to building the best vault at home to hide your money but leaving the front door open.
68,10157877718517100,"How about train?
Less than 50%"
69,10157877545722100,Wfh? My company no announcement. So how?
70,10157877549757100,Might as well go back to phrase 1🙄
71,10157881889882100,"Can the car park capacity at Vivo, Ikea and Raffles City be reduced by 50% too ? Especially over the weekends."
72,10157877651537100,"Change the system of office work make it ""stay at home job"" i dont need to see my boss i just need my laptop and make it done😂"
73,10157877711562100,BTO last for one month only. Never guard down too early.
74,10157878595162100,"This TTSH situation is like a drama showing the police are armed and surrounded other police station for suspect in that station.
Or it is time for the medical association to opt-in Prof. Paul to the joint taskforce?"
75,10157878829887100,"they are overconfident in the first place. too hasty in letting people in, they should have tighter control over the foreign workers. it goes to show that our over reliance on foreign workers is a double edged sword. it is time to restructure the economy and reduce our reliance. the old ways of faster, cheaper and better do not work anymore."
76,10157878108547100,Don't worry. After raya we change to Phase 3 again.
77,10157877567742100,Phase 3 minus Phase 1 equals?
78,10157877607382100,Working from home?
79,10157879955367100,Play safe with cautious approach. Lockdown prevention is the best policy. Control the outbreak.
80,10157877591867100,"Again double standard, hari raya coming all the nonsense starts"
81,10157877580222100,Import more ... Still never close border

104,10157877558697100,Calvin Cheng you happy now???
105,10157877595702100,This is not the citizens. The management of sin city likes to open up borders and invite imported cases to sin city to sin more
106,10157877543902100,"If wanna impost restrictions for the well being of public, should be immediate and not a chosen date. Waiting for cluster to expand ah? 🤦🏻‍♂️"
107,10157877561047100,"In 2020, we had the highest death rates in almost a century and the highest accident rates at worksites despite 2 months of circuit breaker. Was it due to Covid temporary measures or just a coincidence? Think about it..."

115,10157877546427100,Mother’s Day on 9 May
116,10157877561792100,Well done. This is an expected situation when you keep importing viruses into the country from Great Mother India. Keep importing so that we can have circuit breaker again. Love it so much

120,10157877820832100,I think the first step is to stop all flights from India. Even PRs & their dependents and singaporeans shouldn’t be able to return to sg now.. You can’t trust every single person to adhere to SHN strictly.

128,10157877749437100,Whose fault ?
129,10157878005602100,Yay!!! The govt should really consider Circuit Breaker on 08 May instead. No one should be allowed to come out

135,10157877559202100,"Orbee good. Crowd the malls more la, don't wear masks properly la, use eating/
drinking as an excuse to not wear masks more la. Serves y'all right. Be more complacent guys. When clusters and outbreaks like the TTSH one form then blame everybody else and act innocent LOL. Really like dogs sia. Ignorant and self-entitled fools."
136,10157877593452100,Rip mother's day bookings
137,10157877582357100,Good to tighten up. If numbers don't drop please go back to CB asap to cut off the transmission.
138,10157877549717100,F the bloody idiots who let in so many foreigners from a high risk country
139,10157877558767100,"Once again the blame game has started. Ownself refuse to tighten the border restrictions and impose longer SHN duration earlier. We already had no community cases for a long time. Now that the imported cases have leaked out to the community, they had to restrict our activities. We have all been working so hard, especially our front liners, why didn't you spare a thought for our people? Constantly importing cases from a particular country, many not even Singaporean or here for important business!"
140,10157877633562100,Thank you millionaire ministers. Thank you Calvin Cheng. Thank you bootlickers of PAP. We continue to sacrifice for the sake of your beloved CECA. CCB

After the things happening they only will know restricted the policy
In the end suffer for the public people
And no freedom for the people"
142,10157877554372100,"I am still curious about how the nurse got infected. Did the TTSH vaccinated staff stop wearing PPE? Or did she return fr Philippines? How about the patient who had symptoms earlier than her? Did he juz returned fr Overseas since Dec?

So many unknowns...no answer... Then... Back to square one. Hope no CB."
143,10157880261952100,"World’s most vaccinated country now in crisis with deaths rising. They had little cases and no deaths before vaccination. Similar phenomenon in India, Thailand, Vietnam, Israel and many countries.

Nope it cannot be the holy vaccines. Must be the people misbehaved!

158,10157877619382100,"Diagnosed and analyzed the whole picture. The government of today will never admit and released statistical data of all this imported cases from India. How many are New Citizens from India and how many are PR from India. As New Citizens and PRs, the government have no right whatsoever to ban them from coming in ? This are what they call the Imported cases ? This government had dropped the ball so terribly since 2005 when CECA was signed how many Indians from India had granted PRs and New Citizens."

252,10157877630867100,The opening up in early April was way too much/fast. 75% back to office is practically allowing for all to go back. When the borders were wide open to practically all. Too hasty.
253,10157877561317100,"Please ban India flights, India citizens India passport holders India born anyone with a travel history to India. Once you have this ban we will be like before zero community case. Other countries have imposed total ban on India flights and citizens including jail and fine. We should follow in order to protect our citizens."
254,10157877564117100,Haiz.. no apologies for importing cases. All your doing leh garmen. I'm going to have a friendly chat with my MP!
255,10157877557412100,Tighten local measures but fail to shut borders completely on travelers from high-risk countries. What's the point then? What a shame!
256,10157877555032100,Blaming us for not following safe distancing measures again instead of blaming themselves.
257,10157877610822100,Better to be safe than sorry. Stay safe. We cannot afford another circuit breaker. Do stay at home also.
258,10157877599182100,Better to be drastic and safe.. no point fighting it. Even with the vaccine 💉 we are not safe bec this thing is mutating faster than we can can develop the vaccine 😨 Stay safe everyone.
259,10157877637422100,It's ridiculous that the government is forcing pre-event testing on weddings scheduled this month with lesser than 100 people now with so little lead time left to prepare. Can't the government show more empathy and flexibility?
260,10157877794107100,"Well done for stricter measure, Should consider impose back team A and Team B rotation as well. Let's open up more after a good percentage has been vaccinated like 80 percent."
261,10157878077392100,"many sme offices long ago already ask all (100%) back to office...

use other persons' tokens...alread
y our contact tracing so efficient...do tokens and trace together apps communicate with each others...?"
262,10157877580587100,"Finally.. its glad to hear that the taskforce team are implementing more stringent measures. Sorry, folks. Think tts the best solution currently. Better be safe than sorry. Thank you for your understanding. we cant really afford another circuit breaker. What happens already happening. we hv to move on. Be alert, stay safe and minimise social gatherings for a period of time. If all of our hearts stay as one n wirk together as one, we can overcome it, must overcome it and WILL overcome it! Bcos we want our little island 🇸🇬to return to breath with clear air, beautiful sunshine city which the world envy. We can achieve it! ✊🏻✌🏻💪🏻❤️🦁 🇸🇬🙏🏻"
263,10157877554642100,"Just lockdown again lah, our stupid government is the one who opened the boarders and welcome foreigners to enter and now they push the blame to us locals. In the 1st place, do we really need so many new maids? Most of them that came in surely will bring the virus to our country 🤦‍♀️"
264,10157877547537100,Okay why not cut down flights from affected countries then ?
265,10157877584797100,"The signs are already there, yet they chose to wait and see. Again..."
266,10157877566167100,"Last year never react fast enough to close border with China, end up mass dormitory infection, Circuit Breaker, 4 Relief Budget. This year again repeating same with India ?"
267,10157877570957100,I believe we should institute some social distancing in public transportation too.
268,10157877565697100,My boss says he needs to see me in office then he knows I’m working. Is that valid reason for him?
269,10157877587987100,Why? Indian flight keep coming in.
270,10157877616172100,"Is the rule : no more than 50% of employees should be at the office at any one time ( meaning a company who has 100 employees total , can only have 50 on site ) ..

or is it : no more than 50% of employees who can work from home,can be at the office, at any one time ( meaning in the same 100 employee setting , if only 50 of them have the ability to work at home , 50% will be 25... so only 25 of these 50 people can come to office) ?"
271,10157877549642100,"This is shoddy thinking from 4G ministers at best - everyday change policies, flip prata without a clear cut goal.

You just look at how people are eating at restaurants - 30 to 45 mins with their masks off. If 1 unfortunate patron is there from the TTSH or ICA cluster (which I must say has spread quite widely), the whole restaurant will more or less kena."
272,10157877698862100,"Excessive to say the least…it’s really simple: if you don’t want to be infected, stay home. Vaccines are being distributed, wear your mask, limit contact, and be smart while continuing life. It really isn’t that difficult."
273,10157877602412100,"Just in time for Eid. Thanks to those who made this happened. Can't even do a simple handover of power to a new PM, you expect these people to know what is more important? Economy or people?"
274,10157877547502100,Then should stop all flights from the high infectious countries regardless of citizens or PRs from coming in.
275,10157877581372100,Whoever in charge please ownup and harakiri? Failed us singaporeans totally.... other countries voluntarily resign from their positions when they are taken to task..
276,10157877650672100,Last year we didn’t get to raya and this year u wanna do this . Trust us Only 1.5% of 100% people will listen to this .. even if u put 1000 ambassador around.
277,10157877572392100,We kena sacrificed because some people insist to let those people fly in! 🤬
278,10157877565187100,"How come so many people complaining about our own government? Without the FW who will be building the road, clear the rubbish, build houses and many more... Will you be the one? We are not back to ground zero yet but put those measures in place is to ensure the spread stops where it is right now before it gets worse. Please let our government do what they need to, as we people of this nation do our part by keeping those safe distancing and safe measures. If it says 5 means 5 in social gathering.. Not 5 here and 5 on the othet table.. If it says wear a mask and please wear it properly.. Not only covering your mouth.. These measures is also telling us that 'we are too complacent' already. Zero count it doesnt mean we have won the fight against covid19. Having vaccinated it doesn't mean you wont get infected and a mask is not required..."
279,10157877575547100,"Lax rules on outsiders for so long and in turn, we have to bear the tightened restrictions😒😒.. Bravo🙄"
280,10157878278157100,"To MOE

I urge the ministry to send a directive to schools and campuses, to advise all students to stop talking in trains and buses. In the NSL, everyday, I see these polytechnic students yak so loudly and non-stop among themselves. At least, MOE can help to target this big group of youngsters who are totally ignorant on the risk to spread the virus within an enclosed environment.

The four languages constant announcement, big signage affixed on the cabin panels, mrt staff carrying placard walking through the cabin asking commuters Not to talk, but is all USELESS !"
281,10157877543882100,"We citizens have to make so many compromises thanks to this incompetent govt!

Last year, they ignored the foreign worker dorms.

This year, they ignored calls to stop the boarders from reopening to those in high risk countries but they think they know best. Look what is happening now? We citizens have to bear the brunt of their foolishness again!"
282,10157877549862100,It's okay. We still can hari raya inside TRAIN!! 🤣🤣
283,10157877554737100,"The idea of opening the borders is to bring in the workers and help improve the economy.
But what is the economic and social cost of letting in the virus and having such controls?
Is it a case of costs outweigh the gains?"
284,10157877600827100,"Thanks for the refusal to ban flights from high risk countries earlier and now we have to celebrate Hari Raya under strict restrictions again.

TERIMA KASIH!"
285,10157877554982100,Sheng shiong staff: got chance big bonus again!
286,10157877597097100,"Seriously, govt took so long to close borders for short term nonessential travelers, and now all of us have to pay the price for this reluctance to impose travel restrictions! 😡"
287,10157877703842100,"In this scenarios, I would have to consider weighing the economic and spread of virus. Although it is not possible 100% to stop, I must at least slow down its transmissions."
288,10157877560382100,Incompetent gahmen.. all they think is how to boost economy and get back what they give.. now open borders covid come back.. kuang kuang kuang.. congrats
289,10157877635762100,"As a Malaysian, I think it's a wise decision..Just do it for 3 weeks lor no means become like Malaysia then susah.."
290,10157877575092100,I rather CB for 2 weeks now than CB 2 months or more if more cases arise
291,10157877543852100,Thanks ah gahmen. Another hari raya inside the mrt i guess
292,10157879365212100,How about Mrt and other public transport.
293,10157877545907100,MRT/BUS - 50% ? Please advise ….
294,10157877548557100,5 distinct visitors..?? Wow..! Raya is just around the corner..! Let's see after raya..! Will it be still 5 distinct visitors..??
295,10157877590892100,"Thank you very much for the restrictions again!
So tell us what you going to do with al the flights coming in from India and all the High risk countries?
We did our part, and we are tired of these obedience yet someone screwed up policies!"
296,10157877564977100,Testing balloon.Now burst.Citizens had to lockdown again soon.
297,10157877572797100,import to community cases. Good job well done 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
298,10157877627722100,"Not again. So my family of seven cannot visit my parents all at once, BUT, my parents can visit me and my family. The total number of people is the same either way, is it not?

Otak kambing is the person who came up with this regulation."
299,10157877552162100,Now become citizens fault again! U can bring forward all the stupid measures but cannot ban the flight from high risks countries earlier. What nonsense is this ? Are u trying to cover your guilt for the clusters?
300,10157877550397100,"Can bring back CB 2.0 better, people have gone through it and know what to expect. And they are ready too."
301,10157877566087100,Pls close the borders! As Singaporeans we are very obedient in doing what was told but if the government keep on opening up the borders to allow foreigners to come in then we are being persecuted with the tightening measures. It’s unfair to us totally!
302,10157877803087100,Many companies already reverted... this is a few days late
303,10157877599227100,It will never happen in some company.
304,10157877663722100,"Just when we thought things were looking up, and now Hari Raya has to be small group size again. 2 years already."
305,10157877730867100,"In the first place tackle the root cause!!
Never managed the root cause, no points of putting measures every now and then. Stupid stupid... stop the import cases."

308,10157877826487100,"They just told us what to do and what not to do. Pervious lock down we have work together to bring down the infection.

They didn't tell us what is the caused of The spike but using excuse that we need Foreign workers here which I agree but they didn't told us the caused of the spike which we all believe it not cause by the FW.. We just want them to say it out!!"

318,10157877550942100,Wonder what about MRT and Public Transport?

326,10157878595162100,"This TTSH situation is like a drama showing the police are armed and surrounded other police station for suspect in that station.
Or it is time for the medical association to opt-in Prof. Paul to the joint taskforce?"
327,10157878829887100,"they are overconfident in the first place. too hasty in letting people in, they should have tighter control over the foreign workers. it goes to show that our over reliance on foreign workers is a double edged sword. it is time to restructure the economy and reduce our reliance. the old ways of faster, cheaper and better do not work anymore."
328,10157878108547100,Don't worry. After raya we change to Phase 3 again.

356,10157877558697100,Calvin Cheng you happy now???
357,10157877595702100,This is not the citizens. The management of sin city likes to open up borders and invite imported cases to sin city to sin more
358,10157877543902100,"If wanna impost restrictions for the well being of public, should be immediate and not a chosen date. Waiting for cluster to expand ah? 🤦🏻‍♂️"
359,10157877561047100,"In 2020, we had the highest death rates in almost a century and the highest accident rates at worksites despite 2 months of circuit breaker. Was it due to Covid temporary measures or just a coincidence? Think about it..."

366,10157879047847100,Let’s celebrate hari raya at mrt and buses! Yay!
367,10157877546427100,Mother’s Day on 9 May
368,10157877561792100,Well done. This is an expected situation when you keep importing viruses into the country from Great Mother India. Keep importing so that we can have circuit breaker again. Love it so much
369,10157877550237100,Import more...m

372,10157877820832100,I think the first step is to stop all flights from India. Even PRs & their dependents and singaporeans shouldn’t be able to return to sg now.. You can’t trust every single person to adhere to SHN strictly.
373,10157879440187100,Phase 2 part 2: Covid strikes back

379,10157877556057100,😰😥 oh no..our family's 8 May gathering..how?
380,10157877749437100,Whose fault ?
381,10157878005602100,Yay!!! The govt should really consider Circuit Breaker on 08 May instead. No one should be allowed to come out
382,10157877553122100,wfh doesnt apply to us. zzz. my boss... 🙄
383,10157877569942100,Tak habis....after 1 year....cycle continues again...🙄🙄🙄

387,10157877559202100,"Orbee good. Crowd the malls more la, don't wear masks properly la, use eating/
drinking as an excuse to not wear masks more la. Serves y'all right. Be more complacent guys. When clusters and outbreaks like the TTSH one form then blame everybody else and act innocent LOL. Really like dogs sia. Ignorant and self-entitled fools."
388,10157877593452100,Rip mother's day bookings
389,10157877582357100,Good to tighten up. If numbers don't drop please go back to CB asap to cut off the transmission.
390,10157877549717100,F the bloody idiots who let in so many foreigners from a high risk country
391,10157877558767100,"Once again the blame game has started. Ownself refuse to tighten the border restrictions and impose longer SHN duration earlier. We already had no community cases for a long time. Now that the imported cases have leaked out to the community, they had to restrict our activities. We have all been working so hard, especially our front liners, why didn't you spare a thought for our people? Constantly importing cases from a particular country, many not even Singaporean or here for important business!"
392,10157877633562100,Thank you millionaire ministers. Thank you Calvin Cheng. Thank you bootlickers of PAP. We continue to sacrifice for the sake of your beloved CECA. CCB
393,10157877716712100,"Whatever which country all the government are selfish and only want benefits for themselves
After the things happening they only will know restricted the policy
In the end suffer for the public people
And no freedom for the people"
394,10157877554372100,"I am still curious about how the nurse got infected. Did the TTSH vaccinated staff stop wearing PPE? Or did she return fr Philippines? How about the patient who had symptoms earlier than her? Did he juz returned fr Overseas since Dec?

So many unknowns...no answer... Then... Back to square one. Hope no CB."
395,10157880261952100,"World’s most vaccinated country now in crisis with deaths rising. They had little cases and no deaths before vaccination. Similar phenomenon in India, Thailand, Vietnam, Israel and many countries.

Nope it cannot be the holy vaccines. Must be the people misbehaved!

505,10158274299362900,"""This is not a circuit breaker. We certainly hope not to have to invoke another circuit breaker,"" —> actually, it’s time to invoke another circuit breaker. Like, now. It should be now."
506,10158274274057900,"4g make those mess make the citizen clean up not even a apology from them everything they do is right wrong blame it to citizen especially when festival is coming , if we have a good garmen like NZ/ aust we wont be suffering so much now just wait for 4 more years we will overcome this hell"
507,10158274458007900,"What's the point of all this new rules, when you allowed imported cases to rise every single day!"
508,10158274298292900,"Should also look into offices that ask employees to return physically to work everyday instead of heeding government's advice to WFH as much as possible! It's so crowded outside even during off peaks due to the staggered work time that some implement in especially in public transport, F&B and malls"
509,10158274347737900,"Since our Raya is spoilt yet again, compensate us with 14 May PH. Win win, all stay home, virus contained. We happy, u happy, can?"
510,10158274403822900,"My family plan 1st day only siblings & spouse. Every other day, take turns to visit. On positive note, our 90yr old elderly will be happier since everyday got visitors. It makes old good memories of her kampung life..😊"
511,10158274311492900,"Sometimes we can’t blame the government of having a strict policy as some of us are only thinking of their individual needs, and having this “I I I” mindset. Let’s do not let our guards down. Let’s play our part and face this wave together."
512,10158274343667900,"We sporean work hard and follow the SOP. Just hoping everything to be ok. So we can work and earn money for family. And hoping this year can visit my sick mom during hari raya. But all go down to drain. We understand this virus cant be control but at least listen to us lah. Remember you cant work alone you need your citizen to give advise. We share, we work together everything will be fine. Why must u still allow borders to open , airport to open. Pls lah listen to ur citizen voice for once!!!!"
513,10158274267787900,"Why do we need to suffer when government is the one not doing their job. If the border was closed, the ICA officer wouldn't be infected thus won't infect his wife who is working at TTSH. Is simple logic but yet our government choose economy over public health."
514,10158274295037900,All our efforts and sacrifices.. down the drain. We had hope tht thrgh our efforts this year can have a more enjoyable Raya. im sorry but cant help feeling disappointed with the current situation 😞
515,10158274286227900,"""But let's try to avoid that scenario, and let's all do our part.""

Hate this sentence most. As if we did nothing but all you do was jeopardise our effort. Stop covid is everyone’s effort, but when comes to listening to your own citizens, things were silent like we didn’t already warned you this."
516,10158274271017900,"Other countries put restrictions in place for foreigners so their locals can live more freely

Our country open leg big big let foreigners f and put restrictions in place for locals because money"
517,10158274301022900,"Not unexpected. People clearly saw and knew better. especially with reports like 53 on a flight to HK are infected, NZ airport worker got infected after cleaning plane. Letting workers come from highly infected countries is dangerous. And even more so when the tests there cannot be trusted.
But still the high scholars didn't listen. Until too late."
518,10158274289482900,"Why never say Circuit Breaker? Cos Gvmnt scared of forking money again rite?🙄🙄Visiting nvr bring money in mah, thats why created these rules. Kuddos👏👏Very well planned, korang mmg Busuk Hati!!"
519,10158274260457900,Import some more la... now our Muslim friends struggle to meet socially.
520,10158274280122900,"Dejavu all over again. This cap is triggered by the recent rise of COVID-19 cases, which has been going on for a week or so. What I don’t understand is why don’t restrictions take effect right away? Why wait till the 8th? They anticipate something dramatic to happen starting from 8th may?"
521,10158274328992900,"We worked so hard to contain the virus for more than a year but you open doors widely to welcome those ppl and their families from highly infected countries!! And now, see what happened 😡😡. I feel like 😭😭"
522,10158274326672900,"When say faster close border and dont let anyone fm China come in, don’t want. Then Raya we kena CB. We diam2, we did what what was told. Eventho, during that year CNY just had a blast.

Then 2021, CNY, Christmas all happy2 then India. Ask close border don’t want. Again, Hari Raya the one kena.

Peratikan jer perangai."
523,10158274264837900,"Gahmen keep opening doors..now citizens are paying the price for it..wat a way to usher in Aidilfitri..ano
ther year on Zoom..🤦🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️"
524,10158274275542900,Our Hope To Visit My Parents Place With All Our Children Are Quashed. Even Though We Are All From The Same Household 😭😭😭
525,10158274293187900,"What’s the difference? From 8 to 5? Seriously? Haiyoh. Might as well, stop people dining out, just takeaway."
526,10158274268067900,"Did we ask to import, like seriously. Now raya coming impose all this.

When can close border don't want, now see la"
527,10158274271067900,"This shows that LW is totally not suitable for 4G coming leader, if he will to be the leader, a small hiccup he will pull the handbrake or even reversing."
528,10158274264877900,Whats the use??? Mrt buses still full on peak hr.. all stand side by side... reduce no. Of pax doesnt make any difference.
529,10158274303527900,"This is not a circle breaker. It's a "" potentiometer"" this time. To fine tune as and when required."
530,10158274264802900,When it's Hari Raya...all change!!!!
531,750996025582331,After a whole year of sacrifices we expect you to do the right thing. But you failed us miserably.
532,10158274396267900,"We worked so hard to reached phrase 3.
Now we have to make a u turn again.. just because.... dont want close border
Aiyah..."
533,10158274265222900,Walao CNY all so quiet then Hari Raya so happening. Same thing as last year. Maybe they jealous we raya 1 month
534,10158274281387900,CNA what about enrichment centres and dance studios? Any restrictions? Will there be any checks on them to ensure social distancing?
535,304789834347619,Thank you Lawrence Wong to bring us back to phase 2 or maybe CB
536,10158274267627900,Can turn off ERP gantries again.
537,10158274259587900,Less green packet to give out. Good.
538,10158274260832900,"From 5 to 8 from 8 to 5.
5885.. 😆 🤣"
539,10158274266597900,Wow!! just nice..last CNY can get 8 visitors. Now Raya time 5 pax. Just wow!.
540,10158274271522900,High chance if going back to circuit breaker... 🤔
541,10158274258167900,As expected!! No Hari Raya visiting for 2nd year?! Thanks hor!!
542,10158274263817900,"Return to phase 2 is better than full lockdown, for now"
543,10158274278307900,"Awesome! As usual the people have to pay the price for this incompetent and Profits Above People government.

Please open the borders and allow more travelers in leh. Economy collapse how? We don't have the luxury to close our borders and follow the likes of NZ leh."
544,10158274261872900,Any limit on import?????
545,10158274258272900,Coming to hari raya all wanna change jibai

547,10158274300702900,"Thanks Hor! Due to open leg policy and more import cases, there is no Hari Raya visiting for us again! As expected! Kanasai laa! Anyway, cheers and thank you so much!. God bless Singapore Horr!"
548,10158274296052900,"For such a small country like Singapore, PAP is doing a fantastic job in controlling the Covid19. I am so glad me and the 60% voted for you last election.I hope all of us will still be alive to vote for you guys again next election...but if we are unlucky enough to die from Covid19...pleas
e carry on importing foreign talents and their families so that they can replace us to vote for PAP. 🙏😊"
549,10158274299967900,"""It means that the borders of the country have been closed since the END OF MARCH 2020. THERE ARE NO VISITORS COMING TO SINGAPORE - not only from India but pretty much EVERY OTHER COUNTRY.

All other flights to Singapore are bringing onboard CITIZENS and PERMANENT RESIDENTS, as well as approved work pass holders employed in Singapore. NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED - and it has been the law for OVER A YEAR.

And all of them have to get tested upon arrival and serve a Stay at Home Notice of 7 to 21 days depending on the origin country of their departure (it's the latter for anybody with history of travel to India) - and then have to get tested again before their quarantine ends.

Singapore has instituted extremely strict filtering rules that bar most of the travelers from coming in, while placing multiple conditions on everybody else, so that the virus is not transmitted into the community.

In addition it suspended entry of all non-resident pass holders coming from India, even if approval was issued beforehand - TEN DAYS AGO. Seriously...

So, as we speak, the only people allowed on Indian flights are Singaporean citizens and PRs, who are going to get tested and have to spend 21 days in isolation.""

550,10158274267917900,Should we also hold a general election now?
551,10158274270767900,You do all these restriction to prevent community spread of the virus but you still do not wish to shut down our border totally to deny imported cases. WHY?
552,10158274273607900,"Thanks to Ong Ye Kung and Lawrence Wong’s wise leadership that have seen us go 1 step forward and then 2 steps backward.

Thanks to their wise leadership for continuing to allow all sorts of visitors fr high risk countries like India to come in despite the daily warnings."

558,10158274371682900,"To all pap IBs, please remember to ask for a pay rise. The defending work getting tougher day by day. I wonder how much per hour or its like a full time job just like safe distance ambassadors?"
559,10158274315757900,This is too much. When comes CNY 8 visitors n hari raya 5 visitors. This is terribly too much.
560,247481843780500,Aiyah no matter how strict also condo resident bring in vistors and never declare also if security ask say staying with them BCA and MOH should do a rendem check as they think they stay condo means they stay in ISTANA
561,10158274363807900,"As expected, this is the reward for us who follow SOP, who voice out our concern with the lax border control, still allowing travellers from high-risk countries to set foot here...So much for our high salary 4G ministers...All
this could have been avoided, (as some have mentioned here..) the ICA personnel wouldn't get infected, & pass it to his wife which in turn start the domino effect...It's infuriating!!..
Now the main worry, are those asymptomatic among us that unknowingly spreading the virus... Don't put the blame on us Govt, it's you that is not listening to us...We deserve better leaders..."
562,10158274373577900,Should work from home some office still wants staff to go back office eventhough they are just an admin. With crowded mrt and bus just be prepared there will be more cases
563,10158274328107900,"June i think will announce if all not control well. But why not start immediately? Just so amazed by the notice period. Even there is no immediate reaction to stop flights from india to come in that time. They only stop them from coming in 2 days from the day they announce if i remeber correctly.

Haiz... i feel so sad for my malay frens.. 😪 i feel lagi sad cause I cant visit them sia."
564,10158274462487900,"Should , at least listen to the peoples concern, now we have to bear the consequenses...

565,10158274275157900,"If there’s a need to curb the spread, do it immediately. Start now. Why have to wait till then??? Virus not potent enough? Virus will attack only on the 8th? It may not be fair for businesses ya but this is not the time to accommodate….th
e virus knows no bounds regardless of who you are. It does not choose who to infect….it just whack….."
566,10158274497667900,"Most of the imported cases from India were students, old folks and PMETs. Why he said migrant workers?"
567,10158274456152900,We paying the price cos garmen keep our gates open and importing new cases!!
568,10158274363022900,Wedding can accept up to 50 at 1 time but Household visitors only 5? Covid only prone to spread within immediate family members? 4G gahmen logic uh?
569,10158274374072900,Purposely implement this rules during Raya period...start 8May aand lasted for 2 weeks.after raya time over open back to 8 person..Last yr we celebrate raya during CB.
570,10158274482177900,"Actually why must wait till 8th? By setting on 8th , I think only give some ppl to take this 4 days to chiong 8 pax gathering before they have the mindset that on 8th and after only 5 can gather..."
571,10158274339682900,Many people also at workplace also dun bother wearing their masks be it sitting at their own place or moving around in the office. There are even people who will purposely remove their masks when talking.
572,304788414347761,"I wonder.... If the household already have 5 or more people in the family, can they still welcome guests??"
573,10158274296872900,Wedding event should also reduce. Disappointed 😞!
574,10158274273847900,"Then schools remain open?
Gyms close but Classrooms continue to pack 40 students in?
what a joke.
And this is a circuit breaker. don’t lie to the citizens."
575,10158274316247900,"I believe if we have tighten the imported case... this might not happen.....

With the high daily imported cases over months (sure will have loose end) but will you disclose? Or can you actually trace...."
576,10158274300092900,"Shld have a poll, what if GE is this weekend. Predict the results!"
577,10158274312837900,Nice 👍 don’t change back too soon. Unless 1 to 2 months no case. Should Reduce no. People eating too close together outside. Actually I don’t need so many people visit me and eat with me Everyday. Business as usual not affected is more important.
578,10158274370132900,Ahhh can potong the social gathering but dowan to potong the import case 🤦🏽‍♂️
579,10158274320227900,Bush fire turned forest fire. Didn't we told not to play with match stick even 🙄

582,10158274356947900,Meanwhile flights from India just reached Changi airport. Song boh.
583,494921368363201,"Singapore is an open economy..Unlike
some countries, we couldnt be self sufficient. We don't have basic resources. Even bulk of raw water is imported (although over the years the government has increased recycled water to reduce over reliance on imported water). Our construction workers to build our public housing are also imported.Thus opening up our borders on a gradual and controlled basis is unavoidable. As compared to other part of countries in Asia, Singapore is one of few developed countries who has already achieved low infection rate. While reversing into phrase 2 has created inconvenience to a lot of us, it has to be done to avoid what we experienced last year. Frequent hard lockdowns not only impact our economy negatively but our jobs and livelihood too."
584,10158274360552900,Open leg so big any virus also can come in
585,10158274311222900,This is no longer circuit breaker but a motherboard instead!!

587,10158274350377900,"Soon all measures one by one return, but would not call it circuit breaker"
588,377376290181983,Now is the time to control before it goes out of hand!
589,10158274307622900,"This is the sissy attitude of our task force. very indecisive. want to control virus spread and at the same time want to keep economy afloat. cutting from 8 to 5 u think will make any difference? if u tell me just lockdown from 8 to 28 may it make more sense. honestly, IMO the virus is already out there. but they cannot forget abt money, they want gst, they want erp, they dont want to pay rebates, benefits etc."
590,10158274260822900,standard la announcing this news before raya...

598,10158274341287900,The govt punishes its own citizens for the severe mistake it made and is still making. Foreigners from high risk countries take priority. They are still smothered with love and great affection.
599,517634256284645,"Ministry of Health, Singapore .
So how about Public Transport like Buses & Train? Where is the social distance measure?"
600,304780014348601,Don't ask us to do our part! Government should do their part! They make mistake n shove this on us citizens! Think citizens are stupid n just take whatever blames you said?!
601,2934655530187680,"Our gov should adopt a more aggressive lockdown of our airport which they neglect to do so. They should at this present stage seriously think of restructuring our economy to empower all Singaporean to take over all jobs here rather than to depend heavily on foreigners. The government should not continue to marginalize Singaporean. The inert values of Singaporean r there for them to see. This covid period will not pass away any time soon.
Currently they think this is just a storm n their planning is to wait for the storm to cease away quickly."

You just look at how people are eating at restaurants - 30 to 45 mins with their masks off. If 1 unfortunate patron is there from the TTSH or ICA cluster (which I must say has spread quite widely), the whole restaurant will more or less kena."

It's the imported cases that spread the viruses to the community. Confirmed cases while infectious going around to shopping malls, cinemas and F&B outlets! These are the reasons why there are community cases with no link to any cluster! We are heading towards CB phrase 1 if TTSH cluster are not controlled and stop in time for further spread of the virus. Stay home stay safe. God bless all Singaporean 🙏🙏🙏"

979,10158274256907900,Singapore government are too complacent. They start to bar visitors only when cases start arising. We can’t blame the infected ones instead we blame those who allow to let them in. And now the government are blaming locals for not abiding the rules.. when they are the one making those poor choices. Can’t complain much because 61% voted for the PAP. So this is the consequences. But where is the leadership of the PAP?? The promises they made during the general election???

983,10157879105592100,"Some bosses may not follow the 50% employees rule and will look for loopholes. By right, each department should have their staff rotated so that when one get infected, the rest of the department can still function instead of just making use of the full headcount and tell you that half of their employees wfh because in actual fact, the other half arent even office-based such as technical personnel, project manager, etc. So employers have to play a part too."

There seems to be a trend of chasing the shadows here."
985,10157879149217100,"They shouldn't ask employees to go back to workplace in the first place, keep the WFH arrangements a permanent arrangement legally. And the 75 percent is rubbish when the whole office is back."

Stop complaining, everyone play your part and listen to our Government. Closure of fitness facilities are a small price to pay for health ☺️ We can always celebrate the Public Holidays next year 👍🏼

With the strong leadership from our Singapore government , I have no doubt we will emerge from this crisis, stronger than ever. Majulah Singapura"
999,10157879219827100,"Can Mr Lawrence and his team pls show us the research and evidence that all these Non-pharmaceuti
cal interventions (NPIs) work?

On the contrary, according to pandemic data and analysis, none of these measures were recommended in our pre-covid era of pandemic preparedness SOP for respiratory diseases but they were found to be ineffective and still rings true today. What has changed?

Corrupted and junk science has creeped in and politicians all over the world wants to be seen to be doing something but most of these measures have little to no bearings on the general trajectory of the pandemic.

Watch the truth here advocated by tens of thousands of world-renowned scientists, medical professionals and epidemiologists
.

People of Singapore have to start waking up and question the Singapore government using junk science NPIs to hold the public accountable for any clusters.

What the world needs to do is focused protection, not “shut the whole world” hysterical strategy which does more harm than good.

1. Identify the high risk individuals (with hypertension, diabetes, etc) within the hospitals and care and nursing homes.

2. Assign staff who is regularly tested for covid to these high risk group (vaccinated staff does not cut it as vaccination does not prevent infection as shown in recent cases).

3. If you are a family member taking care of a vulnerable at home, you should go for regular testing as well.

This focused protection strategy is endorsed by tens of thousands of epidemiologists
, scientists and medical professionals.

This strategy is much better than wasting time and resources on testing and restricting the healthy general public (which has 99.99% chance of survival) which has little to no impact on the vulnerable.

Last year the move to full HBL during circuit breaker period had proven in developing our students to be adaptable and nimble, to be more self-directed and independent learners. Of course it may cause inconvenience for some households which I believe our gov can assist them case by case but most families will adapt well from previous full HBL experiences."

If garment taking too much risk and refusing to put Singaporean health as priority or is it the economic as priority ? Now still bringing in those foreign workers too work in BTO ?

1068,10158295593747900,Told ya we are just going in circles. From a stringent cb implementation to phase 2 to relaxing the rules in phase 3. This will continue on so forth. We have done our part yet the government still with their stance about the borders. Frustrating!

1073,10158296119047900,"Was hoping for more clarity as to the rules.

For example, if I have a few children, can I go out with them together (eg to take them to school)? Or must we walk in pairs? (Ie one or more children will be left walking alone and unsupervised?)

Another example - can a family go somewhere in a car together? Again, if I drop my kids off at school, do I have to drive them there one by one so we will be in pairs at all times?

I am getting conflicting information from everyone because no one is clear on this.

It is ok for there to be restrictions, but perhaps, more thought could be given to the implementation.
How would a single parent with more than one child then manage? Should one child be left home unsupervised so they can be in “groups of 2”? Or should the children be allowed to go out on their own to get groceries? Or should the children not be allowed to approach their parent when out with him/her?"

1089,10158295584762900,"All because we keep letting in the sg/pr/ pass holders going back and forth from sg to india all along until recently and not raising the SHN to 21 days much earlier.

s including our personal responsibilitie
s as an individuals, even the practicing of good hygienic habits, but however the relevant authority must also diligently do their part to prevent more imported cases from coming in, there is no point if we only enforced strict control & discipline on ourselves which would all be futile if the authorities still open our doors so wide to risky foreigners who keep coming in & causing the number of our imported cases here to rise & spread !"

Is getting local Singapreans back on track and businesses going more essential or your lame reasons such as delay in BTO more important.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

https://

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

1302,10158295618227900,"Fantastic. While the ppl in the country obeyed the strict measures (for some at the expense of their businesses, finances and mental health) , you keep on importing all the sohai cases. The gov has been reactionary and slow at taking preemptive measures. When asked if we should wear masks, initially they said no need only when you are sick. When the ppl ask the government to stop taking in flights from China and those who have been to China, they say don't be xenophobic. You would think that they would have learnt something, better to over prepare than to be ill prepared. But now with India, you danced around terms and now look what has happened. Its frustratingly stressful on health cares services and businesses and of course on society in the country on the whole."
1303,10158295676447900,"Stupid.

Did the infected went into ICU or even need hospital care ? Our most vulnerable and risk group did their vaccination for what?

What happened to our decision makers? Press the panic button under the slightness threat. In hokkien we say ""buay Jai"""

1307,10158295793377900,"What is so important with the air travel from high risk region that that the gov is willing to risk it all and putting the whole country at stake. I think the people, the frontline and the victim of the circumstance need to know what are their sacrifices for."

Citizens are not racist nor xenophobic when they tell you to suspend bringing people from countries with runaway infectious rates. It's common sense for the need in self preservation and preserving what little normality in society left.

Now everything seems gone to waste on top of additional financial burden for tax payers to tide over business entities that's affected by the latest change.

PS Sorry to doctors, nurses and other frontline staff. You've worked hard!"

1369,10158295852362900,"And once we all vaccinate there’ll still be imbeciles who will never cover when they cough and sneeze.. so masks will never go... all this rubbish started because of that unhygienic bunch anyway even with all their rich history and culture can’t muster the basic common sense to adhere to hygiene.

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later."

1497,10158295594487900,I seriously dunno why I’m laughing even tho situation in such bad shape. If garment taking too much risk and refusing to put Singaporean health as priority or is it the economic as priority ? Now still bringing in those foreign workers too work in BTO ? Or do u still need them to sweep the floor ? U reap what u sow. Now economic confirm will get even worse . Thanks you our wise ones.
1498,10158295585467900,Almost like a prelude to a CB. How did we come to this? My premonition about imported cases now becoming reality.
1499,10158295588182900,"If we can bend the curve this time again....can our govt pls listen to the ppl... Restrict boarder opening... Stop trying travel bubble, its a price too high to pay for when 'if' happens .... Pls learn, pls learn hard !"
1500,10158295613522900,"Dining-in is one of the riskiest activities for the spread of COVID.

It’s the right move to restrict it , if we restrict gyms.

We cannot close our borders. Just put in restrictions.

We have to vaccinate fast so we don’t have to keep restricting activities."
1501,10158295891087900,Why can't the govt sometime just listen to us... why must need to wait for the situation getting worst and bring us to this inconvenience and waste our effort to cooperation for the past few mth..
1502,10158295745237900,Very true we cannot close our border.... but we certainly can enforce Stricker restrictions 2 check especially some smart alec who luv 2 say I know wat 2 do. Ya. Wow
1503,10158295599122900,The SOP for swap test in GP clinic really not safe. Everyone sitting at the same area without disinfect one by one waiting for swap test. I just did the test at the corridor of one GP clinic without any cleaning protocol. Now worries being infected by others even though my test results is showing negative now.
1504,10158295626167900,Public transport also hard to maintain 1M distance.
1505,10158295689822900,"Same old story repeating itself like a broken record. The authorities never seem to listen to us citizens - our forewarnings, opinions, misgivings are all brushed aside or ignored. They knew the mayhem the virulent mutant strains were causing overseas. Yet, they continued to rest on their laurels. And then when things go wrong as they have now - we bear the consequences."
1506,10158295738737900,"We citizens have always done our part in social distancing. Has the Garment done their part? If so, why are we still having imported cases daily and where did the more deadly strain come from into Sg?
Accountability seems to be lacking from the top as always."
1507,10158295586302900,"GOV, dont be shy to go back to CB.. this is for the safety of your people! We have been keeping up but look at the current situation now."
1508,10158295761307900,Group sizes limited to 2 but schools and tuition centres are still open. Why is that still not being considered for home based learning.? Most schools have completed the mid-year tests and holidays are around the corner. Please consider closing the schools.

How about MRT, Buses and workplace this places are covered"
1511,10158295583057900,Lockdown locals from visiting airport . Tighten up protocols for in coming flight. Got to be a win win situation for SG. Better be restriction now than be sorry for inaction.
1512,10158295581887900,Should have done this way earlier.. The rules keep changing.. Might as well back to Circuit Breaker.. Frontline drivers rejoice empty roads once again 😂😂
1513,10158295593747900,Told ya we are just going in circles. From a stringent cb implementation to phase 2 to relaxing the rules in phase 3. This will continue on so forth. We have done our part yet the government still with their stance about the borders. Frustrating!
1514,10158295593617900,Who to blame ? Local people ? Who suffer ?
1515,10158295652892900,"At least G realized the needs to control . Hopefully this will be the last Phase 1.5. From the looks of it , the peak is not here yet."

1517,10158295581562900,Thanks! And we re still having those from high risks countries coming in on daily basis.. We can achieve we can achieve!!
1518,10158296119047900,"Was hoping for more clarity as to the rules.

For example, if I have a few children, can I go out with them together (eg to take them to school)? Or must we walk in pairs? (Ie one or more children will be left walking alone and unsupervised?)

Another example - can a family go somewhere in a car together? Again, if I drop my kids off at school, do I have to drive them there one by one so we will be in pairs at all times?

I am getting conflicting information from everyone because no one is clear on this.

It is ok for there to be restrictions, but perhaps, more thought could be given to the implementation.
How would a single parent with more than one child then manage? Should one child be left home unsupervised so they can be in “groups of 2”? Or should the children be allowed to go out on their own to get groceries? Or should the children not be allowed to approach their parent when out with him/her?"
1519,10158295577067900,Act decisively to disrupt virus transmission? I lost track how many time people have feedback to act earlier 😔
1520,10158295578917900,schools should consider hbl immediately to prevent more cases
1521,10158295593457900,K. But I hope they’ll stop this narrative of asking citizens to do their part and what’s not. We all know where this came from……

1528,10158295586482900,How about public transport e.g. MRT can capped at 2 person per train?
1529,10158295600712900,What happens to our FDW on their off days? How are they able to eat? Genuine question 🌻

1532,10158295611087900,So end up we law abiding citizens got Inconvenience again due to our imported cases 🙂
1533,10158295625747900,"There we go again, whole nation affected cause of some peoples irresponsible acts. Jus stop already."
1534,10158295584762900,"All because we keep letting in the sg/pr/ pass holders going back and forth from sg to india all along until recently and not raising the SHN to 21 days much earlier. The chain of transmission from those arrivals probably were already long transmitted to the community, spread wider and deeper already
No different like CB now"

You dun control airport properly
Now everyone suffer
I dun understand why you go visit airport for what knowing there are imported cases and this place is the frontline
I have never visited airport since the start of jan 2020
You work there of course people understand
You should not allow dine in at airports
Dabao ok
You should restrict people going to airport or at least dun allow them to dine in as you are figuring out how virulent this viruses are

s including our personal responsibilitie
s as an individuals, even the practicing of good hygienic habits, but however the relevant authority must also diligently do their part to prevent more imported cases from coming in, there is no point if we only enforced strict control & discipline on ourselves which would all be futile if the authorities still open our doors so wide to risky foreigners who keep coming in & causing the number of our imported cases here to rise & spread !"

You only follow suit after Hong Kong ban all arrivals from India. You need to wake up and realign your objectives. Is getting local Singapreans back on track and businesses going more essential or your lame reasons such as delay in BTO more important. Don't try to be smug and open the borders in the face of this pandemic. If you are so good at following others then take a cue from Australia. You need to open the borders but not now !

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

https://

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

While the ppl in the country obeyed the strict measures (for some at the expense of their businesses, finances and mental health) , you keep on importing all the sohai cases. The gov has been reactionary and slow at taking preemptive measures. When asked if we should wear masks, initially they said no need only when you are sick. When the ppl ask the government to stop taking in flights from China and those who have been to China, they say don't be xenophobic. You would think that they would have learnt something, better to over prepare than to be ill prepared. But now with India, you danced around terms and now look what has happened. Its frustratingly stressful on health cares services and businesses and of course on society in the country on the whole."

1792,10158295626462900,"Could someone cut the salaries of 4G ministers for this gross oversight that made this new breach in pandemic prevention possible?

Citizens are not racist nor xenophobic when they tell you to suspend bringing people from countries with runaway infectious rates. It's common sense for the need in self preservation and preserving what little normality in society left.

Now everything seems gone to waste on top of additional financial burden for tax payers to tide over business entities that's affected by the latest change.

PS Sorry to doctors, nurses and other frontline staff. You've worked hard!"

1814,10158295852362900,"And once we all vaccinate there’ll still be imbeciles who will never cover when they cough and sneeze.. so masks will never go... all this rubbish started because of that unhygienic bunch anyway even with all their rich history and culture can’t muster the basic common sense to adhere to hygiene.

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later."

1947,10157899912007100,Why only no dine in and gathering.. Then how about School... consist of 25 to 30 student in a class.. but working hve to work from home.. taking public transport..
1948,10157899990687100,"I think hawker centres should allow 1 person per table to eat there. This is to cater for essential workers a such as grab delivery , taxi drivers. They should not stay more than 20mins. The last cb, i remembered seeing many essential workers eating in not so proper area. And some of them messed up these areas too."
1949,10157899827252100,"While not entirely related to this...may I know if they will therefore restrict or disallow all Staycations in hotels etc?? In early May, everyone was urged to use up their Rediscover vouchers by end June (before the announcement of extension to Dec)....many of us (I know of friends and family members) had made bookings for staycays or group outings which have a clause that bookings made with Rediscover vouchers cannot be cancelled or changed or face forfeit of entire amount. We maybe a small proportion of the cohort, but if dine in etc is restricted, can you please at least loosen these Rediscover vouchers clauses at hotels and venues etc, so that we don't end up serving a ""SHN-staycay"" in a hotel or losing the full amount of our payment? We can't dine out, so what is the point of a staycay? I'd much rather be really staying home then and without being penalised for something out of my control. Please consider these circumstances and not deal out piecemeal restrictions like this? It's highly destabilising."
1950,3987403311349160,"It’s meaningless just to reduce group sizes gathering and dining prohibited!
Wherby you cant reduce the flow of people’s on public transportation etc and shopping mall etc…
And some of those not so essential business to open!
Places and shop which can’t oblige to safety measures should be prohibited!
Especially street vendor!
And the high risk place is airport!"
1951,10157899836922100,Pls move to HBL with immediate effect before we see rise in cases in schools. All below 16 cannot be vaccinated yet so they will be safest at home.

1954,10157899919867100,"how about your public transport...eve
ryday thousand of peoples squeeze in the mrt and bus but you all just close the eye due to making alot of money from it...open all your eyes and come down to take the public transport during peak hour like a public without any security around to cover...."
1955,10157899872027100,"This what we meant dont be over excited to open up borders.. in the short to medium terms, all country have to live within themselves until the epidemic is cleared."

1957,10157899862987100,"Don’t understand why in the worl are we messing about with SMM when the key is obviously the vaccines. I’m certain that we have the ability and resources, if we want to, to ramp up the vaccination of the population rapidly. Why are we being so slow in vaccinating the population?"
1958,10157899826052100,"Lawrence Wong said in this press con that ‘This is a setback in our fight against COVID-19’. He was the one that said in one of the previous press con saying ‘we need migrant workers to come in to build our homes?’ See lah now? We already controlled the spread until the India variant was in. Now because of their refusal to close the borders, what happened? Community cases numbers went up. This ‘setback’ is caused none other than them."

1964,10157899826017100,Let us just obey the rules bec this is for our own good. Let us set aside the stubborness attitude and selfishness mentality. Let us do our part in combating this variant virus. Let start the discipline in ourselves and Ask for Gods mercy
1965,10157899810627100,"oh no.. can review the 'no dine-in' clause? how are we going to run errands and not dine in anywhere? Hide in toilet to eat ah... And our food delivery riders / taxi drivers, how can they dine anywhere? Can limit to 2 pax dine in per table?"

Sorry to say that my call to MoH has confirmed that this statement is not true. MOH staff said that it does not require the care to be on a daily basis. Also that no other visitors are allowed if the grandparents are in the house.

However, a call to ST for clarification gave a different version. ST staff said that "" on a daily basis"" refers to living together with grandchildren, thus not part of the quota of 2 visitors per day.

Could MoH and ST please be more explicit and explain clearly what the restriction for grandparents is about? The current statements by both sides are very confusing."

2024,10157899906332100,"I would suggest suspension Of all school, enrichment, co curricular and tuition classes temporarily for a month to Ensure that the virus doesn’t spread further.

The virus spreads easily among kids as they attend multiple classes and activities across Singapore in a day, coming into contact with more people than an average adult would.

These kids are our future. If they go down, there’ll be no future for our country.

May I suggest an islandwide circuit breaker for all students temporarily; for schools, tuition and enrichment centres, till we are cleared of this new variant, or till everyone is vaccinated. Education can still continue through online classes.

If it worsens, we can consider an islandwide circuit breaker for adults too.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

2213,1439099676444270,The India variant has been alerted way back in Dec. Being the task force you guys should have study it very closely and prepare for alternative of hiring foreign workers from other less risk countries. Shut borders to India was the most logical common sense to do it for the sake of the citizens. Instead you keep opening border to India thinking that you can manage the risk. Did you even study the India variant itself? How infectious is it?? You sacrifice the whole population for the sake of not delaying projects without the initiative to find other foreign workers. Now many sectors have to close because of your lack of anticipation and poor management. In the end we suffer both - in health and in finance

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later."
2321,3987366048019550,"COVID IS JUST THE TIPPING POINT CAUSING MASS DEATHS

Each and every organ in our body is already very weakened and severely underperforming
due to the contaminated air, food, water, mind, etc. as follows. So our bodies are the ideal places for any virus or disease to easily finish whatever meager health is remaining in our bodies and thus kill us within no time. But still we don't want to give up the below 7 killers of ours. We are just trying to patch up the symptoms when it is already too late while totally ignoring the following root causes of it all.

1. So much pollution in the air which we take in into our lungs every single day in massive proportions.

2. All the pesticides and other dosha-imbalanci
ng items in our food which are eating us up from within day after day.

3. All the artificial and poisonous chemical medicines, drugs, steroids, opioids, etc. which we have dumped into our bodies for decades and thus totally destroyed our own immune system and resistance power totally.

4. All the carcinogenic electromanetic,
radio frequency, etc. radiations and the mental junk and fantasies which all our bodily organs and mind are being constantly microwaved with in this technological age.

5. Mass-scale hatred and violence being inflicted on each other at the drop of the hat.

6. Nature's fury in the name of natural calamities because we are so cruelly exploiting nature to the very hilt for our own greedy and selfish ends.

7, And finally our toxic lust which we indulge in regularly causing the colossal loss and depletion of our seventh dhatu, the very essence of all what we eat, drink, and breathe. This renders all our other 6 dhatus (plasma, blood, muscle, adipose, bones, and marrow) weak and our immune system extremely susceptible to the slightest disease. The animals which engage in the most lust have the shortest lifespans and those who engage the least in lust have the longest lifespans. patanam bindu maranat, rakshanam bindu jivanat.

These 7 are the precise reasons why Srimad Bhagavatam states that people will literally become like dwarfs in primitive villages massacred by their cruel monarchical rulers and eventually live only for a maximum of 15 years as Kaliyuga progresses and ends after 427,000 years. kamala jala dala, jivana talamala, chapala sukha laba lagi re..."

If tomorrow big crowds gather in groups of 5 to eat together and bring children and family to public places and places of interest, won't there be continued spreading?
And worse is if lots of people decide to gather in big group for one last hurrah tomorrow night. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄

What is task force thinking?
Will give them benefit of the doubt.
Will like to think that they are giving businesses enough time to prepare the things required. Like ordering huge amounts if takeaway plastics and boxes, and for all businesses to inform and cancel all classes like yoga and outdoor exercises groups.

Keep safe, everyone!"
2507,10157899936137100,"I do not understand how someone can keep saying ""we cannot close borders""...what
nonsense...it is precisely this sort of attitude that cause this second wave...see what is happening at changi airport..."
2508,10157899929217100,Everything is tighten BUT not shutting down border for 1 mth! Whats the point!
2509,10157900008357100,Is this a circuit breaker in disguise phase? 70% similar to CB except borders not closed. A small CB
2510,10157899955662100,"Some people managed to save their loved ones from a crises back home. And I am glad for them, as a fellow human being. But some people here (and their loved ones) have fallen just because they happened to be trying to keep Singapore safe.

Sigh...."
2511,10157899929412100,Pls close schools immediately. We have been preparing for HBL. Time to move into HBL now.
2512,10157899976482100,"Sudden extreme cut to only 2 pax social gathering. Will we see a spike these 2 nights for gathering and party? Pubs, KTV etc have to close also probably if no dine in allowed."
2513,10157900534957100,"So essential workers who don't have a place to eat have to hide again? Not every essential worker work as food delivery, taxi driver etc who can show evidence as essential worker. Some companies don't provide a place to eat in.

During the circuit breaker I had to hide either at the staircase to eat or drink since my job requires me to go different places daily."
2514,10157900620887100,"Would love for some experts and economists to calculate the gains from keeping the borders open to the highly infected countries.
Vs the financial losses and social costs from having these community infections, stresses to the healthcare system, contact tracing, and disruption to businesses"

2516,10157899945232100,If only listen abd close borders this will not have to happen. Why cant they learn from the past and other countries
2517,10157899986532100,Thank thank you we are back at square one after months of hard work and suffering. Now many many more business will suffer and many many people will be out of job again. Thank you thank you to who ever they are. All efforts wasted.
2518,10157899952032100,"People have been asking to close the borders to those who are from high risk countries but it has fallen on deaf ears or with the reply that we cannot close our borders. Hey! Not asking you to close totally, high risk countries, got it? Obviously not. And now we are back to where we were one year ago..."
2519,10157899925602100,Does this apply to families as well? Cannot be out with 2 parents and 2 children at the same time?
2520,10157899901792100,"So sad.
Back to square one after so many imported cases.

2522,10157900079337100,Of course la. I change car want to apply also reject 9 times. Ask some paper i dont have. Then expect me bring my mum down. Go out only spend then leave me hanging. What this worker doing talking online and email and needing to ask them when you can call or video call. Make me shop unecessarily. Please improve the system
2523,10157899921757100,Should close all schools too.
2524,10157899901562100,"Is this CB2? I am v.confused from the article, cannot go work but can go out for entertainment but cap at 25%?"
2525,10157899897282100,"It is immensely frustrating seeing many other countries slowly getting back to some semblance of normalcy, but here we are (in the so-called best place in the world to be during Covid) now subject to a second lockdown, still under virtually the same restrictions as last April. Especially given that the vast majority of Singaporeans have unquestioningly
accepted and adhered to whatever restrictions and measures that were imposed on us for more than a year.

Who is responsible for being in bed with corporations and refusing to implement a permanent work from home arrangement, but instead force the working class back to the office, resulting in dozens of strangers being jam-packed into every single mrt carriage on the way to school and work during peak hours every day?

Who is responsible for making this country's economy a sham entirely reliant on unsustainable population growth, exploitation of cheap foreign labour, and being a prostitute to foreign capital, such that we have no choice but to continue an open-door import policy in the midst of a pandemic?

I'm so sick and tired of ordinary Singaporeans having to bear responsibility and having to pay the price for the mistakes of our so-called elite leadership."
2526,10157899895077100,"Also, can you also help, what if I have staycays during that period and I paid with SRV and wanna cancel it, can someone enlighten me? I think it's only fair you can refund us the SRVs used. If can that'll be great! Thanks!!"

2530,10157899900292100,"Stay strong. Love from Malaysian, who has just gone into full lockdown about a week ago.💪💪"

2532,10157899964447100,"Students still go school but adults stay at home.
Yoga studios open, but gym close.

What logic?"
2533,10157899907162100,Poor judgement to let travellers from high risk countries lead us to this scenario. Why didn't ban them from entering 2 or 3 months ago ? Why such a huge oversight ?
2534,10157899921892100,What fancy new name they have for this ? Circuit breaker Lite ?
2535,10157899895712100,Let' s name a cat a cat please. Just simply a new lock down. Why not using the right words?

2539,10157899901807100,We have all been v good !! With such a small population sorry to say we are risking all of our lives . Millions already mentioned PLS STOP allowing people to Spore . For whatever reason ! Afraid it’s a lil’ too late now . . Gdluck to all Sporean
2540,10157899897722100,Why mess about with SMM than ramp up vaccinations? There are more administrators at the vaccine centres than people getting vaccinated. We are damn slow...
2541,10157899910352100,Is Cruise holiday affected? What abt SRV trip which involve lunch or dinner?
2542,10157899933482100,Pub and Bistro still can open??? Hope also close as its high risk area too
2543,10157899914087100,Should ban imported cases not ban this type of rules we didnt make it the outbreak to happen its its the imported cases. Its not fair ok !
2544,10157899986082100,its certainly a 2nd Circuit Breaker ! but so ' how lian ' refuse to call it so ?

2554,10157899929207100,"Dining-in is one of the riskiest activities for the spread of COVID.

It’s the right move to restrict it , if we restrict gyms.

We cannot close our borders. Just put in more restrictions.

We have to vaccinate fast so we don’t have to keep restricting activities."
2555,10157900090667100,"Basically, ask we all to take cover and go for shelter. while they import many import cases. They prefer us to hide yourself, rather than close border. Do you see the picture here"
2556,10157899980562100,Wonder if there is any 75% JSS for those affected businesses
2557,10157899900367100,then can spas still operate?

2559,10157901879387100,The obvious way was shut the gate for time being....and block knon cases coming in ..obviously gov not listen and thereare still fake entries...
2560,10157900256692100,"Failed job. Period.

Allowing contagious travellers to enter Singapore -> increase chances that airport staff will be infected -> allowing staff working in contagious area to eat in the food court for the public -> public gets infected -> starts spreading in the community.

Allowing Ministers to rotate in different ministries when they have not even settle down and know what they need to know.

Failed at various levels."
2561,10157900158377100,So if company dont allow WFH can we report them?
2562,10157900071737100,"Qn, is toddler below 2 years considered 1 pax?"

We can never have a sustainable phase 3 if we continue to be so lax on the border restrictions. It will always be community spread, contain, control then imported cases and back to CB/phase 2.
Expected this the moment they announced back to phase 2 less than 2 weeks ago. We do not have a confident Taskforce team who can effectively deal with the situation and the people / business are made to suffer because of the inept handling."

To put things in perspective, New York City has a land mass of 468.19 sq mi, a population of 8.4 million and a daily average of 648 Covid cases. Singapore has a land mass of 281.2 sq mi, a population of 5.8 million and a daily average of 21 Covid cases. The population density of New York City and Singapore stands at 27,755.25/sq mi and 21,646/sq m respectively.

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last month that the city will reopen 100% on July 1. Why on earth are we still stuck in limbo?

If garment taking too much risk and refusing to put Singaporean health as priority or is it the economic as priority ? Now still bringing in those foreign workers too work in BTO ? Or do u still need them to sweep the floor ? U reap what u sow. Now economic confirm will get even worse . Thanks you our wise ones.
2700,10158295585467900,Almost like a prelude to a CB. How did we come to this? My premonition about imported cases now becoming reality.

It’s the right move to restrict it , if we restrict gyms.

We cannot close our borders. Just put in restrictions.

We have to vaccinate fast so we don’t have to keep restricting activities."
2703,10158295891087900,Why can't the govt sometime just listen to us... why must need to wait for the situation getting worst and bring us to this inconvenience and waste our effort to cooperation for the past few mth..

2705,10158295599122900,The SOP for swap test in GP clinic really not safe. Everyone sitting at the same area without disinfect one by one waiting for swap test. I just did the test at the corridor of one GP clinic without any cleaning protocol. Now worries being infected by others even though my test results is showing negative now.
2706,10158295626167900,Public transport also hard to maintain 1M distance.
2707,10158295689822900,"Same old story repeating itself like a broken record. The authorities never seem to listen to us citizens - our forewarnings, opinions, misgivings are all brushed aside or ignored. They knew the mayhem the virulent mutant strains were causing overseas. Yet, they continued to rest on their laurels. And then when things go wrong as they have now - we bear the consequences."
2708,10158295738737900,"We citizens have always done our part in social distancing. Has the Garment done their part? If so, why are we still having imported cases daily and where did the more deadly strain come from into Sg?
Accountability seems to be lacking from the top as always."

2713,10158295583057900,Lockdown locals from visiting airport . Tighten up protocols for in coming flight. Got to be a win win situation for SG. Better be restriction now than be sorry for inaction.
2714,10158295581887900,Should have done this way earlier.. The rules keep changing.. Might as well back to Circuit Breaker.. Frontline drivers rejoice empty roads once again 😂😂
2715,10158295593747900,Told ya we are just going in circles. From a stringent cb implementation to phase 2 to relaxing the rules in phase 3. This will continue on so forth. We have done our part yet the government still with their stance about the borders. Frustrating!
2716,10158295593617900,Who to blame ? Local people ? Who suffer ?
2717,10158295652892900,"At least G realized the needs to control . Hopefully this will be the last Phase 1.5. From the looks of it , the peak is not here yet."

2719,10158295581562900,Thanks! And we re still having those from high risks countries coming in on daily basis.. We can achieve we can achieve!!
2720,10158296119047900,"Was hoping for more clarity as to the rules.

For example, if I have a few children, can I go out with them together (eg to take them to school)? Or must we walk in pairs? (Ie one or more children will be left walking alone and unsupervised?)

Another example - can a family go somewhere in a car together? Again, if I drop my kids off at school, do I have to drive them there one by one so we will be in pairs at all times?

I am getting conflicting information from everyone because no one is clear on this.

It is ok for there to be restrictions, but perhaps, more thought could be given to the implementation.
How would a single parent with more than one child then manage? Should one child be left home unsupervised so they can be in “groups of 2”? Or should the children be allowed to go out on their own to get groceries? Or should the children not be allowed to approach their parent when out with him/her?"
2721,10158295577067900,Act decisively to disrupt virus transmission? I lost track how many time people have feedback to act earlier 😔
2722,10158295578917900,schools should consider hbl immediately to prevent more cases

2736,10158295584762900,"All because we keep letting in the sg/pr/ pass holders going back and forth from sg to india all along until recently and not raising the SHN to 21 days much earlier.

I have never visited airport since the start of jan 2020
You work there of course people understand
You should not allow dine in at airports
Dabao ok
You should restrict people going to airport or at least dun allow them to dine in as you are figuring out how virulent this viruses are
The latest being b1617 variant

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

While the ppl in the country obeyed the strict measures (for some at the expense of their businesses, finances and mental health) , you keep on importing all the sohai cases. The gov has been reactionary and slow at taking preemptive measures. When asked if we should wear masks, initially they said no need only when you are sick. When the ppl ask the government to stop taking in flights from China and those who have been to China, they say don't be xenophobic. You would think that they would have learnt something, better to over prepare than to be ill prepared. But now with India, you danced around terms and now look what has happened. Its frustratingly stressful on health cares services and businesses and of course on society in the country on the whole."

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later."

3148,10157901785607100,"I believe some parents would want the Gov to make it mandatory for all tuition centres, enrichment/
private tuitions to move lessons online.
We know that nothing is for sure because the world had yet fully understand this COVID-19 and it’s new variants at this stage, the Gov need to take actions soonest in this matter before our situation turn worse🙏 Thank you"
3149,10157901351502100,I am concerned how will the school conduct PE lessons from 16May? My child told me that they are playing games in groups with masks taken out currently. How to have safe distancing when their PE lessons are conducted this way? It is just loopholes with MOE's planning.
3150,10157900975497100,Bring schools holiday forward and keep the kids safe now community too many cases
3151,10157901485802100,"The Straits Times I’m angered by two recent ST headlines about how teachers must wear masks and how schools must have fixed seating! What do you think schools have been doing until now? All our SMM efforts for the past year have become rubbish thanks to ST, with all the worried parents and keyboard warriors now unloading their panic onto this perceived lack of SMM in schools! Unbelievable!"
3152,10157900898867100,"I’m surprised at home many comments asking sch to close now. For primary school going kids, you as parents would know that not all schools have finished WA. (You would have known what WA means if you have pri sch gg kids)"
3153,10157901357837100,"They still mingle during their PE lessons with their masks off 🤦🏻‍♀️

Be proactive leaders not reactive lah. Left 2 more weeks before June holidays, might as well close all the schools before more students are infected!"
3154,10157903799542100,"Gov took latest actions and only allows 2 pax being together but have kids running around schools and allow mamy kids to be in same classroom regardless of the 1 M social distancing. This is absurb. Close school earlier and avoid more future pains if kids get infected. Children are playful by nature, how to control all of them at same time? And teachers will have a hard time teaching with mask on the whole session. They have to talk or at times talk very loudly, alot of saliva will spill onto their own mask. Unless school provides mutiple change of masks for teacher per day, it will be a hard time for teacher which will ultimately affects the young learners."
3155,10157901740657100,"Be truth and honest! Anybody went to T3 or close related to T3 workers should self quarantine and look after your own health condition. This will help to stop virus spreading. Even though you did not receive SHN yet your family is one of the SHN related, please stay at home"

3157,10157902038782100,"Anyway to find out how many imported cases and community cases? And any website to check for those daily imported cases, and what are they? Meaning citizens, PRS, dependents etc? I m just curious not asking for trouble"
3158,10157901531177100,"Seriously makes no sense by letting the school to operate as per normal at current situation. Keeping them 1m apart doesn’t bring them safe too. Some lower primary children don’t handle their mask well.

Please don’t repeat the same mistake."
3159,10157901415882100,Biggest joke. You pack the classes so tight n refuse to reduce number per class and expect 1m distancing. Impossible task. The physical space even on paper cannot work.
3160,10157901050962100,Should start HBL by now instead of all the measures since exposure to infection is still at high risk. Be responsible...
3161,10157901282797100,"For the safety of all students, bring the June holidays forward!"
3162,10157903995547100,Fantastic! Im sure we will win the world cup when we conduct soccer lessons online!

And don't forget that we have a group of vulnerable people who still attending the schools and centers that can't comply with the safety measures, even can't put on masks. Want to wait and see or stop now."

3170,10157901030037100,Students from IHL shouldn't return to schools when no dining in is allowed. It makes no sense that they couldn't eat properly even if they could do takeaways. Exception is made for MOE schools but their term will close in 2 weeks time. Policies sometime are contradictory and not properly thought through.

3178,10157901411682100,Fundamental question is that Dining-in is not allowed at all eateries n restaurants but why school's canteen can be allowed for students to dine-in????
3179,10157902247812100,After everything under control and traced than start sch again..
3180,10157901922547100,"No logic, must HBL for all students."

[The restriction does not apply to passengers from the same household. For example, a parent can travel with his or her two children if they live together, LTA said.]

{We recognise that there may be occasions where members of the same household may need to move about in groups larger than two persons, especially those with young children or elderly parents in order to look after their higher care needs. These may include taking public transport, going for medical appointments, attending classes or going to work in the same vehicle. We are prepared to be flexible in our implementation of the general rule for such bonafide cases.

3432,10158300275727900,only 2 person in a bus n mrt please..
3433,10158301125052900,Aiyo! Poor thing! I prefer my 3 kids to be in school. Maybe not very convenient if parents hv to WFH and kids hv to do HBL at the same time? And kids have to have their outside time too? Good for their development. Now so restrictive again. I was so happy when I thought that SG is going to open up but now back to square one or even 1 step back from square 1?
3434,10158300680837900,Great. MMTF finally acknowledges that this variant is quite virulent and closing the schools is necessary.
3435,10158300754597900,"Please, people. Can be reasonable??? Do also die, don't do also die.
There are people who want schools to open and some who want schools to close.
Preschool children are young and will require care. Don't just think of yourselves. If their parents are both essential workers and could not afford a helper, then who is going to take care of their kids? Not everyone is so lucky to stay home, ok??? You are encouraged NOT to send your children to preschool, but please leave a road for the ones who need the service!"
3436,10158300738152900,"Is a right step to take. However, we must be mindful of the more venerable children with complicated family where school setting is a better environment for their learning and building of confident and character. Hope social services efforts increase to look out for these."
3437,10158300685097900,"It takes 7 primary schools and 11 students to finally bring schools to a halt and carry on with HBL, which is a far safer option than being on site in school.

Schools are never a safer option compared to homes due to the enlarged and enclosed areas where the students are held. Just look at the canteens, no matter how stringent the covid-19 measures are, especially with the double mutated strains, covid-19 will certainly prevail among our young ones."
3438,10158300716277900,"So.. The signal is very clear already.. After that we will back to last Yr CB.. Because parents will need to take care of the kids..
Let's hope this move will contain the virus and eveyone do our parts to make everyone safe.. 💖✌️"
3439,10158300719912900,"Partial closures, moving to HBL, Work from home and all sorts of requirements do nothing but complicate daily lives and activities. There is a need for us to be proactive rather than being reactive. All these temporary measures might help in the short term but learning from our past migrant worker dormitory outbreak experience, I find there is an urgent need to shutdown completely for 2-3 weeks. We have to do this now before the case numbers spike in hundreds. At that point, HBL, Work from home, MOH coming to pick up suspected cases and sending to hotels for quarantines and such, none of this will remain sustainable or effective. Closures of course will call for government support which seems to be lacking with current measures. All businesses will suffer during this time. I believe people will accept closing down for 2-3 weeks completely and receive some form of government support to tide over this period rather than staying open but with a list of things “not to do” and take another deep financial hit. We can use this 2-3 weeks of closure to create a world record of fastest vaccination drive in a country. Vaccinate every single one. May be.

3440,10158301704362900,"Can just cancel all the ongoing/
upcoming mid year exams and have a longer mid year school holiday? The simpler the arrangement is, the better for all. Lesser stress for all - parents, teachers and students."
3441,10158300779887900,"Still remain some rooms for those kids whose parents not able to offer HBL due to working or some special reasons, Schools still need to provide certain supports for the kind of families’ kids. 🙏"
3442,10158300686712900,"Pls let ur children stay home don't make noise because most of us will WFH so don't complain for pre sch still open but if u work from home try to let them at home unless under circumstances..
.please don't be an arrogant ppl"
3443,10158300702477900,"For young kids, personally think, they will be
TOO active at home. Their parents should
let them have a HOBBY, e.g. keeping PETS !!"
3444,10158300683262900,"Good. No romping in malls after school hours will cut down infection possibilities. And with parents working from home, it should remind parents who have forgotten Phase 1 what it was like working from home as well as keep them away from getting infected and spreading the virus during their lunch breaks at work."
3445,10158300735457900,Should close all borders. Putting pre school students and student care kids at more risk in this case.
3446,10158300682427900,"'Announcing this on Sunday, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said authorities understand that the shift to full home-based learning ""may cause anxiety in some parents""

U don't shift to home base then will cause anxiety to parent lo!"

3448,10158300777517900,"Needs time to to make
the procedure,
preparation and detail.
Immediately, not logical.
You give a logical plan,
immediately."
3449,10158300685137900,good to protect the kids from covid
3450,10158300721782900,"Just close the borders!
What’s the point of restricting internally but still letting the imports in."
3451,10158300685572900,"It's now or never. Now that the viruses are spreading in the community, all schools should closed for the time being as our children are not vaccinated and it would be very risky to expose them to the risk out there now. Please stay home stay safe. Now this is not the time to gather and shopping in malls. We wouldn't want to return to Phrase 1 when we completely stop all activities and stay at home. Let us do our part and stop this spread together."
3452,10158300736412900,"Now talk about school .. what’s next... have the government look into day care centre for senior or waiting for another case to Happen? Really no one know.. just My thoughts...vacc
ination is not exlir... vaccines are developed as of earlier situation but now it have become different kind of variant as of now"
3453,10158300778032900,Wait.. affect younger children then y student care n preschool still can operate...? Another half baked policy
3454,10158300736527900,Close Preschools Too!!! They're younger and have poorer immune system
3455,10158300692147900,OMG! Why left the pre-schoolers to go school and the rest all HBL. Gov still think that pre-schoolers need to learn more then the rest?
3456,10158300694717900,"I wish Singapore can close all borders permanently till next year, just like Australia did."
3457,10158300752997900,How abt preschool teachers who have pri sch going kids ?
3458,10158300705747900,What's the logic? So many preschoolers attending extra enrichment too. They are not at risk too? Why they still need to go to school?
3459,10158300695647900,"Personally think The schools should start the SCHOOL
holidays earlier !! To avoid the crowds !!"
3460,10158300723817900,Why wait till Wednesday? You mean they have to choose a special date?
3461,10158300687872900,Its not unexpected and this time round at least CCS is doing it right unlike LW and OYK.
3462,10158300706032900,And whose fault is that again? For bringing in this more virulent strain??
3463,10158300690092900,Piecemeal measures ... still waiting for government to impose ban on receiving passengers from high risk regions.
3464,10158300705172900,"Still don understand why let so many indians come into Singapore when never heard of more Indians leaving sg so need replacement. Economy is slowing down. There aren't increased constructions or sudden extra cleaning work to do done and most dormitory worker from last year should be back to work by now. So why we need to get more fw in? Even maid has to come n go. We need more figures break down of who is coming in or leaving, the detail for more than 10k imported since april, how many are Ep, why they are approved to come in with their dependents and paid so high. Is really a bad impact to sg in the end if sg is locked down. The lost is greater then getting fw to come in since they don't generate income (other then one time quarantine or swap test income). Now making paranoid got to stay at home, avoid school n office, can't go shops or eat out. And this affect working parents a lot. Its super hard to work with kids around. Not declared a Cb so no subsidies to anyone, pte drivers/self employed or low income family who at first got meal help in sch?"
3465,10158300688907900,I just heard now parents are screaming and crying...
3466,10158300706382900,"How about staff working in preschools/
childcares? Childcare teachers with children in Primary/
Secondary Schools, who are the sole caregivers to these children, are unable to care for them and be at work at the same time. How are the Early Childhood Educators provided with support in this situation?"
3467,10158300713427900,"Yes, good decision, because the kids' Safety is more important than anything else!"
3468,10158300695687900,Power la CCS! I was just discussing this topic with children and the news came in. Thanks for understanding our anxiety as parent.👍👍👍
3469,10158300682032900,Why to start only on Wed?! It should be implemented immediately!! It’s not logical
3470,10158300738502900,Actually why don't just bring forward the school holidays like last year?
3471,10158300686777900,Good move. We cannot let undesired things get us down. We can achieve!
3472,10158300780202900,Every hour got changes... think we r so free ah need update ... minister so free is it... look like out of control
3473,10158300693567900,At least now reasonable reasoning come from him rather then cotton come from sheep.
3474,10158300691217900,"Children are the future pillars of our nation – It’s our responsibility to protect them , wise decision 👍"
3475,10158300690047900,"Still want poly students to go back for practicals and lab work, simply asking for trouble. Want to HBL then apply to everyone. Virus perhaps excused those going to polys."
3476,10158300678627900,This is the right thing to do. Next few weeks critical in keeping situation under control.
3477,10158300681517900,New Education minister starting the ball rolling
3478,10158300700332900,But still passengers from india keep coming in at changi airport..

3481,10158300685292900,Thanks governement for creating all these mess
3482,10158300691952900,"No choice, just got to do it. We can’t let the children’s get infected. The children’s are innocent and should not bear the faults for what the country is facing now."
3483,10158300796207900,Parents’ blood pressure goes up from Wednesday onwards.
3484,10158300711262900,Who is this tuition teacher that spread to these children. Is she from INDIA or just returned from INDIA

3486,10158300697162900,Few days ago say school is still consider safe 🤣🤣🤣
3487,10158300901512900,"Anyone smells CB round 2 soon ? Like seriously we had weeks of 0 cases and now bam we are back to square 1.

Why ? Because our government always takes action only when it’s too late"
3488,10158300710297900,"“Thus far, we have no conclusive evidence of school-based transmission”"
3489,10158300872577900,The most right step to take is close the border (airport) & stop in “imports”
3490,10158300698592900,"Ex transport minister say school not the source of the virus, seems like school not so serious, no need to close, now new education boss say close, it must be quite serious.
Must support this new minster."
3491,10158300749517900,I am kinda worried for preschoolers as well ):
3492,10158300944752900,"How about those poor need to work daily income for food? Money won’t fly down from sky ,Stay home die go work maybe not die ~"
3493,10158300710047900,Time to charge up those ipads parents! Just joking.

3510,10158300994682900,How about those ITE and Poly students?
3511,10158300696962900,"This is why we can’t have nice things. Must meet one last time in groups of 8 last week, must dine out one last time this week 🤦🏻‍♂️"

3524,10158300703377900,Good... With this decided move on to decide on vaccination roadmap...
3525,10158300899762900,"But after that, they goes to the library. Hence, whats the difference???"
3526,10158300708387900,"Already late, better than never though"
3527,10158301028537900,That is excellent for all students !
3528,10158301003982900,"It is never too late to realise they should have done better. Children are absolutely vulnerable partly due to their age. At any point of time, we have to keep them as top priority in decisions making"

3536,10158300934102900,Hahaha...well expected that these measures are coming up again...
3537,10158301033272900,Longer closure is better.
3538,10158300871862900,"At this rate, by next wk CB. School, then essential shops, business."
3539,10158301980172900,Well finally they came to their senses to implement this altho its a bit late... but better late then never. Implementing HBL is better than a full lockdown...
3540,10158300689392900,More students are gonna be infected in the coming weeks. It would be good for some group to adopt HBL until they are eligible for vaccination.
3541,10158300733517900,Task force should have him. He is clear cut. Thankful he is Minister of Education now. Not LW.
3542,10158301494127900,Good.At least the buses and trains are more quiet without those kids on board.

3544,10158300745707900,Absolutely neccessary right after the exams. This time round the ball game is different. No more spreading in dorm.

But USA, UK, Singapore, Germany and Australia have all reported large numbers of infected cases with the Indian variant B1617. Inclusive of India, none of the above countries reported children being at higher risks.

You all can do military coup, if your background are china and Russia government.
UN is nothing.
All others selected governments are nothing.
China +Russia power is greater than total of all other’s countries power.
A good example is Myanmar military coup."

3697,10158300677837900,Malani Selvaraj😟
3698,10157877630867100,The opening up in early April was way too much/fast. 75% back to office is practically allowing for all to go back. When the borders were wide open to practically all. Too hasty.
3699,10157877561317100,"Please ban India flights, India citizens India passport holders India born anyone with a travel history to India. Once you have this ban we will be like before zero community case. Other countries have imposed total ban on India flights and citizens including jail and fine. We should follow in order to protect our citizens."
3700,10157877564117100,Haiz.. no apologies for importing cases. All your doing leh garmen. I'm going to have a friendly chat with my MP!
3701,10157877557412100,Tighten local measures but fail to shut borders completely on travelers from high-risk countries. What's the point then? What a shame!
3702,10157877555032100,Blaming us for not following safe distancing measures again instead of blaming themselves.
3703,10157877610822100,Better to be safe than sorry. Stay safe. We cannot afford another circuit breaker. Do stay at home also.
3704,10157877599182100,Better to be drastic and safe.. no point fighting it. Even with the vaccine 💉 we are not safe bec this thing is mutating faster than we can can develop the vaccine 😨 Stay safe everyone.
3705,10157877637422100,It's ridiculous that the government is forcing pre-event testing on weddings scheduled this month with lesser than 100 people now with so little lead time left to prepare. Can't the government show more empathy and flexibility?
3706,10157877794107100,"Well done for stricter measure, Should consider impose back team A and Team B rotation as well. Let's open up more after a good percentage has been vaccinated like 80 percent."
3707,10157878077392100,"many sme offices long ago already ask all (100%) back to office...

use other persons' tokens...alread
y our contact tracing so efficient...do tokens and trace together apps communicate with each others...?"
3708,10157877580587100,"Finally.. its glad to hear that the taskforce team are implementing more stringent measures. Sorry, folks. Think tts the best solution currently. Better be safe than sorry. Thank you for your understanding. we cant really afford another circuit breaker. What happens already happening. we hv to move on. Be alert, stay safe and minimise social gatherings for a period of time. If all of our hearts stay as one n wirk together as one, we can overcome it, must overcome it and WILL overcome it!

3709,10157877554642100,"Just lockdown again lah, our stupid government is the one who opened the boarders and welcome foreigners to enter and now they push the blame to us locals. In the 1st place, do we really need so many new maids? Most of them that came in surely will bring the virus to our country 🤦‍♀️"
3710,10157877547537100,Okay why not cut down flights from affected countries then ?
3711,10157877584797100,"The signs are already there, yet they chose to wait and see. Again..."
3712,10157877566167100,"Last year never react fast enough to close border with China, end up mass dormitory infection, Circuit Breaker, 4 Relief Budget. This year again repeating same with India ?"
3713,10157877570957100,I believe we should institute some social distancing in public transportation too.
3714,10157877565697100,My boss says he needs to see me in office then he knows I’m working. Is that valid reason for him?
3715,10157877587987100,Why? Indian flight keep coming in.
3716,10157877616172100,"Is the rule : no more than 50% of employees should be at the office at any one time ( meaning a company who has 100 employees total , can only have 50 on site ) ..

or is it : no more than 50% of employees who can work from home,can be at the office, at any one time ( meaning in the same 100 employee setting , if only 50 of them have the ability to work at home , 50% will be 25... so only 25 of these 50 people can come to office) ?"
3717,10157877549642100,"This is shoddy thinking from 4G ministers at best - everyday change policies, flip prata without a clear cut goal.

You just look at how people are eating at restaurants - 30 to 45 mins with their masks off. If 1 unfortunate patron is there from the TTSH or ICA cluster (which I must say has spread quite widely), the whole restaurant will more or less kena."
3718,10157877698862100,"Excessive to say the least…it’s really simple: if you don’t want to be infected, stay home. Vaccines are being distributed, wear your mask, limit contact, and be smart while continuing life. It really isn’t that difficult."
3719,10157877602412100,"Just in time for Eid. Thanks to those who made this happened. Can't even do a simple handover of power to a new PM, you expect these people to know what is more important? Economy or people?"
3720,10157877547502100,Then should stop all flights from the high infectious countries regardless of citizens or PRs from coming in.
3721,10157877581372100,Whoever in charge please ownup and harakiri? Failed us singaporeans totally.... other countries voluntarily resign from their positions when they are taken to task..
3722,10157877650672100,Last year we didn’t get to raya and this year u wanna do this . Trust us Only 1.5% of 100% people will listen to this .. even if u put 1000 ambassador around.
3723,10157877572392100,We kena sacrificed because some people insist to let those people fly in! 🤬
3724,10157877565187100,"How come so many people complaining about our own government? Without the FW who will be building the road, clear the rubbish, build houses and many more... Will you be the one? We are not back to ground zero yet but put those measures in place is to ensure the spread stops where it is right now before it gets worse. Please let our government do what they need to, as we people of this nation do our part by keeping those safe distancing and safe measures. If it says 5 means 5 in social gathering.. Not 5 here and 5 on the othet table.. If it says wear a mask and please wear it properly.. Not only covering your mouth.. These measures is also telling us that 'we are too complacent' already. Zero count it doesnt mean we have won the fight against covid19. Having vaccinated it doesn't mean you wont get infected and a mask is not required..."
3725,10157877575547100,"Lax rules on outsiders for so long and in turn, we have to bear the tightened restrictions😒😒.. Bravo🙄"
3726,10157878278157100,"To MOE

I urge the ministry to send a directive to schools and campuses, to advise all students to stop talking in trains and buses. In the NSL, everyday, I see these polytechnic students yak so loudly and non-stop among themselves. At least, MOE can help to target this big group of youngsters who are totally ignorant on the risk to spread the virus within an enclosed environment.

The four languages constant announcement, big signage affixed on the cabin panels, mrt staff carrying placard walking through the cabin asking commuters Not to talk, but is all USELESS !"
3727,10157877543882100,"We citizens have to make so many compromises thanks to this incompetent govt!

Last year, they ignored the foreign worker dorms.

This year, they ignored calls to stop the boarders from reopening to those in high risk countries but they think they know best. Look what is happening now? We citizens have to bear the brunt of their foolishness again!"
3728,10157877549862100,It's okay. We still can hari raya inside TRAIN!! 🤣🤣
3729,10157877554737100,"The idea of opening the borders is to bring in the workers and help improve the economy.
But what is the economic and social cost of letting in the virus and having such controls?
Is it a case of costs outweigh the gains?"
3730,10157877600827100,"Thanks for the refusal to ban flights from high risk countries earlier and now we have to celebrate Hari Raya under strict restrictions again.

TERIMA KASIH!"
3731,10157877554982100,Sheng shiong staff: got chance big bonus again!
3732,10157877597097100,"Seriously, govt took so long to close borders for short term nonessential travelers, and now all of us have to pay the price for this reluctance to impose travel restrictions! 😡"
3733,10157877703842100,"In this scenarios, I would have to consider weighing the economic and spread of virus. Although it is not possible 100% to stop, I must at least slow down its transmissions."
3734,10157877560382100,Incompetent gahmen.. all they think is how to boost economy and get back what they give.. now open borders covid come back.. kuang kuang kuang.. congrats

Otak kambing is the person who came up with this regulation."
3745,10157877552162100,Now become citizens fault again! U can bring forward all the stupid measures but cannot ban the flight from high risks countries earlier. What nonsense is this ? Are u trying to cover your guilt for the clusters?
3746,10157877550397100,"Can bring back CB 2.0 better, people have gone through it and know what to expect. And they are ready too."
3747,10157877566087100,Pls close the borders! As Singaporeans we are very obedient in doing what was told but if the government keep on opening up the borders to allow foreigners to come in then we are being persecuted with the tightening measures. It’s unfair to us totally!
3748,10157877803087100,Many companies already reverted... this is a few days late
3749,10157877599227100,It will never happen in some company.

3751,10157877730867100,"In the first place tackle the root cause!!
Never managed the root cause, no points of putting measures every now and then. Stupid stupid... stop the import cases."
3752,10157877551152100,We’re supposed to understand what a big pow wow is supposed to mean 😂
3753,10157877894227100,"This Covid, or sarcastically in our local Iban lingo in Sarawak, "" Kumbit"" , really punishes us all to no end!"
3754,10157877826487100,"They just told us what to do and what not to do. Pervious lock down we have work together to bring down the infection.

They didn't tell us what is the caused of The spike but using excuse that we need Foreign workers here which I agree but they didn't told us the caused of the spike which we all believe it not cause by the FW.. We just want them to say it out!!"
3755,10157879871747100,"My department need 100% to be back in office even I had gp letter she still want me to go back and mention gp letter cannot take into consideration, Gp not a doctor?"

3762,10157878097137100,Why dun quarantine those affected India at Istana
3763,10157878928657100,"This is not phase 2. There is a distinct difference in phase 2 and current workplace requirements. Phase 2 requires individual who can wfh to spend 50% time wfh. Now dont have leh. Just 50% limit at workplace.

And wfh is still not default"
3764,10157877550942100,Wonder what about MRT and Public Transport?
3765,10157877746542100,It's akin to building the best vault at home to hide your money but leaving the front door open.
3766,10157877718517100,"How about train?
Less than 50%"
3767,10157877545722100,Wfh? My company no announcement. So how?

3772,10157878595162100,"This TTSH situation is like a drama showing the police are armed and surrounded other police station for suspect in that station.
Or it is time for the medical association to opt-in Prof. Paul to the joint taskforce?"
3773,10157878829887100,"they are overconfident in the first place. too hasty in letting people in, they should have tighter control over the foreign workers. it goes to show that our over reliance on foreign workers is a double edged sword. it is time to restructure the economy and reduce our reliance. the old ways of faster, cheaper and better do not work anymore."
3774,10157878108547100,Don't worry. After raya we change to Phase 3 again.
3775,10157877567742100,Phase 3 minus Phase 1 equals?

3803,10157877595702100,This is not the citizens. The management of sin city likes to open up borders and invite imported cases to sin city to sin more
3804,10157877543902100,"If wanna impost restrictions for the well being of public, should be immediate and not a chosen date. Waiting for cluster to expand ah? 🤦🏻‍♂️"
3805,10157877561047100,"In 2020, we had the highest death rates in almost a century and the highest accident rates at worksites despite 2 months of circuit breaker. Was it due to Covid temporary measures or just a coincidence? Think about it..."

3818,10157877820832100,I think the first step is to stop all flights from India. Even PRs & their dependents and singaporeans shouldn’t be able to return to sg now.. You can’t trust every single person to adhere to SHN strictly.
3819,10157879440187100,Phase 2 part 2: Covid strikes back

3833,10157877559202100,"Orbee good. Crowd the malls more la, don't wear masks properly la, use eating/
drinking as an excuse to not wear masks more la. Serves y'all right. Be more complacent guys. When clusters and outbreaks like the TTSH one form then blame everybody else and act innocent LOL. Really like dogs sia. Ignorant and self-entitled fools."
3834,10157877593452100,Rip mother's day bookings
3835,10157877582357100,Good to tighten up. If numbers don't drop please go back to CB asap to cut off the transmission.
3836,10157877549717100,F the bloody idiots who let in so many foreigners from a high risk country
3837,10157877558767100,"Once again the blame game has started. Ownself refuse to tighten the border restrictions and impose longer SHN duration earlier. We already had no community cases for a long time. Now that the imported cases have leaked out to the community, they had to restrict our activities. We have all been working so hard, especially our front liners, why didn't you spare a thought for our people? Constantly importing cases from a particular country, many not even Singaporean or here for important business!"
3838,10157877633562100,Thank you millionaire ministers. Thank you Calvin Cheng. Thank you bootlickers of PAP. We continue to sacrifice for the sake of your beloved CECA. CCB
3839,10157877716712100,"Whatever which country all the government are selfish and only want benefits for themselves
After the things happening they only will know restricted the policy
In the end suffer for the public people
And no freedom for the people"
3840,10157877554372100,"I am still curious about how the nurse got infected. Did the TTSH vaccinated staff stop wearing PPE? Or did she return fr Philippines? How about the patient who had symptoms earlier than her? Did he juz returned fr Overseas since Dec?

So many unknowns...no answer... Then... Back to square one. Hope no CB."
3841,10157880261952100,"World’s most vaccinated country now in crisis with deaths rising. They had little cases and no deaths before vaccination. Similar phenomenon in India, Thailand, Vietnam, Israel and many countries.

Nope it cannot be the holy vaccines. Must be the people misbehaved!

3953,10158274458007900,"What's the point of all this new rules, when you allowed imported cases to rise every single day!"
3954,10158274298292900,"Should also look into offices that ask employees to return physically to work everyday instead of heeding government's advice to WFH as much as possible! It's so crowded outside even during off peaks due to the staggered work time that some implement in especially in public transport, F&B and malls"
3955,10158274347737900,"Since our Raya is spoilt yet again, compensate us with 14 May PH. Win win, all stay home, virus contained. We happy, u happy, can?"
3956,10158274403822900,"My family plan 1st day only siblings & spouse. Every other day, take turns to visit. On positive note, our 90yr old elderly will be happier since everyday got visitors. It makes old good memories of her kampung life..😊"
3957,10158274311492900,"Sometimes we can’t blame the government of having a strict policy as some of us are only thinking of their individual needs, and having this “I I I” mindset. Let’s do not let our guards down. Let’s play our part and face this wave together."

And hoping this year can visit my sick mom during hari raya. But all go down to drain. We understand this virus cant be control but at least listen to us lah. Remember you cant work alone you need your citizen to give advise. We share, we work together everything will be fine. Why must u still allow borders to open , airport to open. Pls lah listen to ur citizen voice for once!!!!"
3959,10158274267787900,"Why do we need to suffer when government is the one not doing their job. If the border was closed, the ICA officer wouldn't be infected thus won't infect his wife who is working at TTSH. Is simple logic but yet our government choose economy over public health."
3960,10158274295037900,All our efforts and sacrifices.. down the drain. We had hope tht thrgh our efforts this year can have a more enjoyable Raya. im sorry but cant help feeling disappointed with the current situation 😞
3961,10158274286227900,"""But let's try to avoid that scenario, and let's all do our part.""

Hate this sentence most. As if we did nothing but all you do was jeopardise our effort. Stop covid is everyone’s effort, but when comes to listening to your own citizens, things were silent like we didn’t already warned you this."

Letting workers come from highly infected countries is dangerous. And even more so when the tests there cannot be trusted.
But still the high scholars didn't listen. Until too late."

3966,10158274280122900,"Dejavu all over again. This cap is triggered by the recent rise of COVID-19 cases, which has been going on for a week or so. What I don’t understand is why don’t restrictions take effect right away? Why wait till the 8th? They anticipate something dramatic to happen starting from 8th may?"
3967,10158274328992900,"We worked so hard to contain the virus for more than a year but you open doors widely to welcome those ppl and their families from highly infected countries!! And now, see what happened 😡😡. I feel like 😭😭"
3968,10158274326672900,"When say faster close border and dont let anyone fm China come in, don’t want. Then Raya we kena CB. We diam2, we did what what was told. Eventho, during that year CNY just had a blast.

Then 2021, CNY, Christmas all happy2 then India. Ask close border don’t want. Again, Hari Raya the one kena.

3980,10158274281387900,CNA what about enrichment centres and dance studios? Any restrictions? Will there be any checks on them to ensure social distancing?
3981,304789834347619,Thank you Lawrence Wong to bring us back to phase 2 or maybe CB

Please open the borders and allow more travelers in leh. Economy collapse how? We don't have the luxury to close our borders and follow the likes of NZ leh."

3993,10158274300702900,"Thanks Hor! Due to open leg policy and more import cases, there is no Hari Raya visiting for us again! As expected! Kanasai laa! Anyway, cheers and thank you so much!. God bless Singapore Horr!"
3994,10158274296052900,"For such a small country like Singapore, PAP is doing a fantastic job in controlling the Covid19. I am so glad me and the 60% voted for you last election.I hope all of us will still be alive to vote for you guys again next election...but if we are unlucky enough to die from Covid19...pleas
e carry on importing foreign talents and their families so that they can replace us to vote for PAP. 🙏😊"
3995,10158274299967900,"""It means that the borders of the country have been closed since the END OF MARCH 2020. THERE ARE NO VISITORS COMING TO SINGAPORE - not only from India but pretty much EVERY OTHER COUNTRY.

All other flights to Singapore are bringing onboard CITIZENS and PERMANENT RESIDENTS, as well as approved work pass holders employed in Singapore. NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED - and it has been the law for OVER A YEAR.

And all of them have to get tested upon arrival and serve a Stay at Home Notice of 7 to 21 days depending on the origin country of their departure (it's the latter for anybody with history of travel to India) - and then have to get tested again before their quarantine ends.

Singapore has instituted extremely strict filtering rules that bar most of the travelers from coming in, while placing multiple conditions on everybody else, so that the virus is not transmitted into the community.

In addition it suspended entry of all non-resident pass holders coming from India, even if approval was issued beforehand - TEN DAYS AGO. Seriously...

So, as we speak, the only people allowed on Indian flights are Singaporean citizens and PRs, who are going to get tested and have to spend 21 days in isolation.""

4029,494921368363201,"Singapore is an open economy..Unlike
some countries, we couldnt be self sufficient. We don't have basic resources. Even bulk of raw water is imported (although over the years the government has increased recycled water to reduce over reliance on imported water). Our construction workers to build our public housing are also imported.Thus opening up our borders on a gradual and controlled basis is unavoidable. As compared to other part of countries in Asia, Singapore is one of few developed countries who has already achieved low infection rate. While reversing into phrase 2 has created inconvenience to a lot of us, it has to be done to avoid what we experienced last year. Frequent hard lockdowns not only impact our economy negatively but our jobs and livelihood too."

4035,10158274307622900,"This is the sissy attitude of our task force. very indecisive. want to control virus spread and at the same time want to keep economy afloat. cutting from 8 to 5 u think will make any difference? if u tell me just lockdown from 8 to 28 may it make more sense. honestly, IMO the virus is already out there. but they cannot forget abt money, they want gst, they want erp, they dont want to pay rebates, benefits etc."

So how about Public Transport like Buses & Train? Where is the social distance measure?"
4046,304780014348601,Don't ask us to do our part! Government should do their part! They make mistake n shove this on us citizens! Think citizens are stupid n just take whatever blames you said?!
4047,2934655530187680,"Our gov should adopt a more aggressive lockdown of our airport which they neglect to do so. They should at this present stage seriously think of restructuring our economy to empower all Singaporean to take over all jobs here rather than to depend heavily on foreigners.

Waiting for some overpaid minister to answer why that is so..."
4219,10158274280062900,The sentiment on the ground is getting angry. Pls address the elephant in the room about the borders and apologise for the poor measures of allowing people from highly infected places to enter and threaten our safety. Is that degree important? Is visiting important? We cannot do these if we are dead. We have no power as commoners but you people at the top hold the reins. Do something right; do something brave if you truly place Singaporeans first.

4223,10158274278522900,"I found it funny, where all the cases came from? We already stop having community cases for about 6 months and when airport open up and full arms welcome them, cases of spreading start all over again. Tighten singaporean but keep import viruses in.

What the actual medicine you are selling? You know who have cause this community spread again. Why no action been action but keep tighten singaporean?

It just don’t make sense keep on asking singaporean to be responsible but main cause don’t come from us.

4424,10158274257447900,Bye last 3 friends 👋
4425,10158274256907900,Singapore government are too complacent. They start to bar visitors only when cases start arising. We can’t blame the infected ones instead we blame those who allow to let them in. And now the government are blaming locals for not abiding the rules.. when they are the one making those poor choices. Can’t complain much because 61% voted for the PAP. So this is the consequences. But where is the leadership of the PAP?? The promises they made during the general election???

4428,10157882057657100,Smart employers would have make plans at the first instances knowing that this is a long battle to fight. A few more times like that confirm go berserk... 😅
4429,10157879105592100,"Some bosses may not follow the 50% employees rule and will look for loopholes. By right, each department should have their staff rotated so that when one get infected, the rest of the department can still function instead of just making use of the full headcount and tell you that half of their employees wfh because in actual fact, the other half arent even office-based such as technical personnel, project manager, etc. So employers have to play a part too."
4430,10157879268687100,"Strongly urged until such time that clusters form in the workplace, and then enforcement will be put in place to ensure adherence.

There seems to be a trend of chasing the shadows here."
4431,10157879149217100,"They shouldn't ask employees to go back to workplace in the first place, keep the WFH arrangements a permanent arrangement legally. And the 75 percent is rubbish when the whole office is back."
4432,10157881872667100,during BCP does staff need to complete 44 hours per week set by MOM?
4433,10157881600632100,I still have ppl asking me go back to office for casual meeting.
4434,10157879048912100,Make sure enforcement is stepped up then. So many SMEs flout the rules even during phase 1
4435,10157879273027100,The issue is not about the workplace. Solve the issue of distancing at public transport which is 10 times more dangerous first.
4436,10157879952427100,Those who had been working from home the whole week prior to this ruling can continue to do so from home after this

of the highest order should be reserved especially for the Engineering genius Mr.Gan Kim Yong, the lady with the most beautiful heart Josephine Teo, the (erm...) Lawrence Wong and all the 4G leaders.We will definitely not be where we are today without their wise decisions. We are so excited to have a second lockdown awaiting us so we can all stay home and contemplate about life! Remember to ask your family and friends to Vote for PAP again next election! Thank you PAP! 🙏😊"
4441,10157879138867100,"suggest for 70% to work from home, if possible. Reason being: Will be able to see the reduction of crowds in public transports which also a cause to worry of spread from asymptomatic cases. As this 2 weeks is a crucial period. 😬🙏🏻"

Stop complaining, everyone play your part and listen to our Government. Closure of fitness facilities are a small price to pay for health ☺️ We can always celebrate the Public Holidays next year 👍🏼

With the strong leadership from our Singapore government , I have no doubt we will emerge from this crisis, stronger than ever. Majulah Singapura"
4445,10157879219827100,"Can Mr Lawrence and his team pls show us the research and evidence that all these Non-pharmaceuti
cal interventions (NPIs) work?

On the contrary, according to pandemic data and analysis, none of these measures were recommended in our pre-covid era of pandemic preparedness SOP for respiratory diseases but they were found to be ineffective and still rings true today. What has changed?

Corrupted and junk science has creeped in and politicians all over the world wants to be seen to be doing something but most of these measures have little to no bearings on the general trajectory of the pandemic.

Watch the truth here advocated by tens of thousands of world-renowned scientists, medical professionals and epidemiologists
.

People of Singapore have to start waking up and question the Singapore government using junk science NPIs to hold the public accountable for any clusters.

What the world needs to do is focused protection, not “shut the whole world” hysterical strategy which does more harm than good.

1. Identify the high risk individuals (with hypertension, diabetes, etc) within the hospitals and care and nursing homes.

2. Assign staff who is regularly tested for covid to these high risk group (vaccinated staff does not cut it as vaccination does not prevent infection as shown in recent cases).

3. If you are a family member taking care of a vulnerable at home, you should go for regular testing as well.

This focused protection strategy is endorsed by tens of thousands of epidemiologists
, scientists and medical professionals.

This strategy is much better than wasting time and resources on testing and restricting the healthy general public (which has 99.99% chance of survival) which has little to no impact on the vulnerable.

4447,10157879015352100,"I agreed with some parents, I will suggest full HBL for our students. Hope we don’t take actions only when we started seeing rising cases, situation turns more serious. Because ALL lives matter.
Last year the move to full HBL during circuit breaker period had proven in developing our students to be adaptable and nimble, to be more self-directed and independent learners. Of course it may cause inconvenience for some households which I believe our gov can assist them case by case but most families will adapt well from previous full HBL experiences."

Not 5 here and 5 on the othet table.. If it says wear a mask and please wear it properly.. Not only covering your mouth.. These measures is also telling us that 'we are too complacent' already.

4572,10157878595162100,"This TTSH situation is like a drama showing the police are armed and surrounded other police station for suspect in that station.
Or it is time for the medical association to opt-in Prof. Paul to the joint taskforce?"
4573,10157878829887100,"they are overconfident in the first place. too hasty in letting people in, they should have tighter control over the foreign workers. it goes to show that our over reliance on foreign workers is a double edged sword. it is time to restructure the economy and reduce our reliance. the old ways of faster, cheaper and better do not work anymore."
4574,10157878108547100,Don't worry. After raya we change to Phase 3 again.

4603,10157877595702100,This is not the citizens. The management of sin city likes to open up borders and invite imported cases to sin city to sin more
4604,10157877543902100,"If wanna impost restrictions for the well being of public, should be immediate and not a chosen date. Waiting for cluster to expand ah? 🤦🏻‍♂️"

4614,10157877561792100,Well done. This is an expected situation when you keep importing viruses into the country from Great Mother India. Keep importing so that we can have circuit breaker again. Love it so much

4618,10157877820832100,I think the first step is to stop all flights from India. Even PRs & their dependents and singaporeans shouldn’t be able to return to sg now.. You can’t trust every single person to adhere to SHN strictly.
4619,10157879440187100,Phase 2 part 2: Covid strikes back

4633,10157877559202100,"Orbee good. Crowd the malls more la, don't wear masks properly la, use eating/
drinking as an excuse to not wear masks more la. Serves y'all right. Be more complacent guys. When clusters and outbreaks like the TTSH one form then blame everybody else and act innocent LOL. Really like dogs sia. Ignorant and self-entitled fools."
4634,10157877593452100,Rip mother's day bookings
4635,10157877582357100,Good to tighten up. If numbers don't drop please go back to CB asap to cut off the transmission.
4636,10157877549717100,F the bloody idiots who let in so many foreigners from a high risk country
4637,10157877558767100,"Once again the blame game has started. Ownself refuse to tighten the border restrictions and impose longer SHN duration earlier. We already had no community cases for a long time. Now that the imported cases have leaked out to the community, they had to restrict our activities. We have all been working so hard, especially our front liners, why didn't you spare a thought for our people? Constantly importing cases from a particular country, many not even Singaporean or here for important business!"
4638,10157877633562100,Thank you millionaire ministers. Thank you Calvin Cheng. Thank you bootlickers of PAP. We continue to sacrifice for the sake of your beloved CECA. CCB

So many unknowns...no answer... Then... Back to square one. Hope no CB."
4641,10157880261952100,"World’s most vaccinated country now in crisis with deaths rising. They had little cases and no deaths before vaccination. Similar phenomenon in India, Thailand, Vietnam, Israel and many countries.

Nope it cannot be the holy vaccines. Must be the people misbehaved!

4751,10158274299362900,"""This is not a circuit breaker. We certainly hope not to have to invoke another circuit breaker,"" —> actually, it’s time to invoke another circuit breaker. Like, now. It should be now."
4752,10158274274057900,"4g make those mess make the citizen clean up not even a apology from them everything they do is right wrong blame it to citizen especially when festival is coming , if we have a good garmen like NZ/ aust we wont be suffering so much now just wait for 4 more years we will overcome this hell"
4753,10158274458007900,"What's the point of all this new rules, when you allowed imported cases to rise every single day!"
4754,10158274298292900,"Should also look into offices that ask employees to return physically to work everyday instead of heeding government's advice to WFH as much as possible! It's so crowded outside even during off peaks due to the staggered work time that some implement in especially in public transport, F&B and malls"
4755,10158274347737900,"Since our Raya is spoilt yet again, compensate us with 14 May PH. Win win, all stay home, virus contained. We happy, u happy, can?"
4756,10158274403822900,"My family plan 1st day only siblings & spouse. Every other day, take turns to visit. On positive note, our 90yr old elderly will be happier since everyday got visitors. It makes old good memories of her kampung life..😊"
4757,10158274311492900,"Sometimes we can’t blame the government of having a strict policy as some of us are only thinking of their individual needs, and having this “I I I” mindset. Let’s do not let our guards down. Let’s play our part and face this wave together."
4758,10158274343667900,"We sporean work hard and follow the SOP. Just hoping everything to be ok. So we can work and earn money for family. And hoping this year can visit my sick mom during hari raya. But all go down to drain. We understand this virus cant be control but at least listen to us lah. Remember you cant work alone you need your citizen to give advise. We share, we work together everything will be fine. Why must u still allow borders to open , airport to open. Pls lah listen to ur citizen voice for once!!!!"
4759,10158274267787900,"Why do we need to suffer when government is the one not doing their job. If the border was closed, the ICA officer wouldn't be infected thus won't infect his wife who is working at TTSH. Is simple logic but yet our government choose economy over public health."
4760,10158274295037900,All our efforts and sacrifices.. down the drain. We had hope tht thrgh our efforts this year can have a more enjoyable Raya. im sorry but cant help feeling disappointed with the current situation 😞
4761,10158274286227900,"""But let's try to avoid that scenario, and let's all do our part.""

Hate this sentence most. As if we did nothing but all you do was jeopardise our effort. Stop covid is everyone’s effort, but when comes to listening to your own citizens, things were silent like we didn’t already warned you this."
4762,10158274271017900,"Other countries put restrictions in place for foreigners so their locals can live more freely

Our country open leg big big let foreigners f and put restrictions in place for locals because money"
4763,10158274301022900,"Not unexpected. People clearly saw and knew better. especially with reports like 53 on a flight to HK are infected, NZ airport worker got infected after cleaning plane. Letting workers come from highly infected countries is dangerous. And even more so when the tests there cannot be trusted.
But still the high scholars didn't listen. Until too late."
4764,10158274289482900,"Why never say Circuit Breaker? Cos Gvmnt scared of forking money again rite?🙄🙄Visiting nvr bring money in mah, thats why created these rules. Kuddos👏👏Very well planned, korang mmg Busuk Hati!!"
4765,10158274260457900,Import some more la... now our Muslim friends struggle to meet socially.
4766,10158274280122900,"Dejavu all over again. This cap is triggered by the recent rise of COVID-19 cases, which has been going on for a week or so. What I don’t understand is why don’t restrictions take effect right away? Why wait till the 8th? They anticipate something dramatic to happen starting from 8th may?"
4767,10158274328992900,"We worked so hard to contain the virus for more than a year but you open doors widely to welcome those ppl and their families from highly infected countries!! And now, see what happened 😡😡. I feel like 😭😭"
4768,10158274326672900,"When say faster close border and dont let anyone fm China come in, don’t want. Then Raya we kena CB. We diam2, we did what what was told. Eventho, during that year CNY just had a blast.

Then 2021, CNY, Christmas all happy2 then India. Ask close border don’t want. Again, Hari Raya the one kena.

4772,10158274268067900,"Did we ask to import, like seriously. Now raya coming impose all this.

When can close border don't want, now see la"
4773,10158274271067900,"This shows that LW is totally not suitable for 4G coming leader, if he will to be the leader, a small hiccup he will pull the handbrake or even reversing."
4774,10158274264877900,Whats the use??? Mrt buses still full on peak hr.. all stand side by side... reduce no. Of pax doesnt make any difference.
4775,10158274303527900,"This is not a circle breaker. It's a "" potentiometer"" this time. To fine tune as and when required."
4776,10158274264802900,When it's Hari Raya...all change!!!!
4777,750996025582331,After a whole year of sacrifices we expect you to do the right thing. But you failed us miserably.
4778,10158274396267900,"We worked so hard to reached phrase 3.
Now we have to make a u turn again.. just because.... dont want close border
Aiyah..."
4779,10158274265222900,Walao CNY all so quiet then Hari Raya so happening. Same thing as last year. Maybe they jealous we raya 1 month
4780,10158274281387900,CNA what about enrichment centres and dance studios? Any restrictions? Will there be any checks on them to ensure social distancing?
4781,304789834347619,Thank you Lawrence Wong to bring us back to phase 2 or maybe CB
4782,10158274267627900,Can turn off ERP gantries again.
4783,10158274259587900,Less green packet to give out. Good.

5885.. 😆 🤣"
4785,10158274266597900,Wow!! just nice..last CNY can get 8 visitors. Now Raya time 5 pax. Just wow!.

4787,10158274258167900,As expected!! No Hari Raya visiting for 2nd year?! Thanks hor!!
4788,10158274263817900,"Return to phase 2 is better than full lockdown, for now"
4789,10158274278307900,"Awesome! As usual the people have to pay the price for this incompetent and Profits Above People government.

Please open the borders and allow more travelers in leh. Economy collapse how? We don't have the luxury to close our borders and follow the likes of NZ leh."
4790,10158274261872900,Any limit on import?????

4793,10158274300702900,"Thanks Hor! Due to open leg policy and more import cases, there is no Hari Raya visiting for us again! As expected! Kanasai laa! Anyway, cheers and thank you so much!. God bless Singapore Horr!"
4794,10158274296052900,"For such a small country like Singapore, PAP is doing a fantastic job in controlling the Covid19. I am so glad me and the 60% voted for you last election.I hope all of us will still be alive to vote for you guys again next election...but if we are unlucky enough to die from Covid19...pleas
e carry on importing foreign talents and their families so that they can replace us to vote for PAP. 🙏😊"
4795,10158274299967900,"""It means that the borders of the country have been closed since the END OF MARCH 2020. THERE ARE NO VISITORS COMING TO SINGAPORE - not only from India but pretty much EVERY OTHER COUNTRY.

All other flights to Singapore are bringing onboard CITIZENS and PERMANENT RESIDENTS, as well as approved work pass holders employed in Singapore. NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED - and it has been the law for OVER A YEAR.

And all of them have to get tested upon arrival and serve a Stay at Home Notice of 7 to 21 days depending on the origin country of their departure (it's the latter for anybody with history of travel to India) - and then have to get tested again before their quarantine ends.

Singapore has instituted extremely strict filtering rules that bar most of the travelers from coming in, while placing multiple conditions on everybody else, so that the virus is not transmitted into the community.

In addition it suspended entry of all non-resident pass holders coming from India, even if approval was issued beforehand - TEN DAYS AGO. Seriously...

So, as we speak, the only people allowed on Indian flights are Singaporean citizens and PRs, who are going to get tested and have to spend 21 days in isolation.""

this could have been avoided, (as some have mentioned here..) the ICA personnel wouldn't get infected, & pass it to his wife which in turn start the domino effect...It's infuriating!!..

4817,10158274339682900,Many people also at workplace also dun bother wearing their masks be it sitting at their own place or moving around in the office. There are even people who will purposely remove their masks when talking.

4829,494921368363201,"Singapore is an open economy..Unlike
some countries, we couldnt be self sufficient. We don't have basic resources. Even bulk of raw water is imported (although over the years the government has increased recycled water to reduce over reliance on imported water). Our construction workers to build our public housing are also imported.Thus opening up our borders on a gradual and controlled basis is unavoidable. As compared to other part of countries in Asia, Singapore is one of few developed countries who has already achieved low infection rate. While reversing into phrase 2 has created inconvenience to a lot of us, it has to be done to avoid what we experienced last year. Frequent hard lockdowns not only impact our economy negatively but our jobs and livelihood too."
4830,10158274360552900,Open leg so big any virus also can come in

4834,377376290181983,Now is the time to control before it goes out of hand!
4835,10158274307622900,"This is the sissy attitude of our task force. very indecisive. want to control virus spread and at the same time want to keep economy afloat. cutting from 8 to 5 u think will make any difference? if u tell me just lockdown from 8 to 28 may it make more sense. honestly, IMO the virus is already out there. but they cannot forget abt money, they want gst, they want erp, they dont want to pay rebates, benefits etc."

So how about Public Transport like Buses & Train? Where is the social distance measure?"
4846,304780014348601,Don't ask us to do our part! Government should do their part! They make mistake n shove this on us citizens! Think citizens are stupid n just take whatever blames you said?!
4847,2934655530187680,"Our gov should adopt a more aggressive lockdown of our airport which they neglect to do so. They should at this present stage seriously think of restructuring our economy to empower all Singaporean to take over all jobs here rather than to depend heavily on foreigners. The government should not continue to marginalize Singaporean. The inert values of Singaporean r there for them to see. This covid period will not pass away any time soon.
Currently they think this is just a storm n their planning is to wait for the storm to cease away quickly."

It's the imported cases that spread the viruses to the community. Confirmed cases while infectious going around to shopping malls, cinemas and F&B outlets!

5030,10158274454857900,"Why is Singapore not shutting its border with UK (181) and South Africa (158), when was the first variant detected, 475 imported cases with the variant can easily be as far back as since 17 April 2021, why is the public only informed today after 17 days, covid-19 should not be politicize but manage by PROFESSIONALS, B1617 was not just 1 case but 121 cases, with such incompetence and yet pointing the blame to Singaporeans for community spread

5225,10158274256907900,Singapore government are too complacent. They start to bar visitors only when cases start arising. We can’t blame the infected ones instead we blame those who allow to let them in. And now the government are blaming locals for not abiding the rules.. when they are the one making those poor choices. Can’t complain much because 61% voted for the PAP. So this is the consequences. But where is the leadership of the PAP?? The promises they made during the general election???

5228,10157882057657100,Smart employers would have make plans at the first instances knowing that this is a long battle to fight. A few more times like that confirm go berserk... 😅
5229,10157879105592100,"Some bosses may not follow the 50% employees rule and will look for loopholes. By right, each department should have their staff rotated so that when one get infected, the rest of the department can still function instead of just making use of the full headcount and tell you that half of their employees wfh because in actual fact, the other half arent even office-based such as technical personnel, project manager, etc. So employers have to play a part too."
5230,10157879268687100,"Strongly urged until such time that clusters form in the workplace, and then enforcement will be put in place to ensure adherence.

There seems to be a trend of chasing the shadows here."
5231,10157879149217100,"They shouldn't ask employees to go back to workplace in the first place, keep the WFH arrangements a permanent arrangement legally. And the 75 percent is rubbish when the whole office is back."
5232,10157881872667100,during BCP does staff need to complete 44 hours per week set by MOM?
5233,10157881600632100,I still have ppl asking me go back to office for casual meeting.
5234,10157879048912100,Make sure enforcement is stepped up then. So many SMEs flout the rules even during phase 1
5235,10157879273027100,The issue is not about the workplace. Solve the issue of distancing at public transport which is 10 times more dangerous first.

Stop complaining, everyone play your part and listen to our Government. Closure of fitness facilities are a small price to pay for health ☺️ We can always celebrate the Public Holidays next year 👍🏼

With the strong leadership from our Singapore government , I have no doubt we will emerge from this crisis, stronger than ever. Majulah Singapura"
5245,10157879219827100,"Can Mr Lawrence and his team pls show us the research and evidence that all these Non-pharmaceuti
cal interventions (NPIs) work?

On the contrary, according to pandemic data and analysis, none of these measures were recommended in our pre-covid era of pandemic preparedness SOP for respiratory diseases but they were found to be ineffective and still rings true today. What has changed?

Corrupted and junk science has creeped in and politicians all over the world wants to be seen to be doing something but most of these measures have little to no bearings on the general trajectory of the pandemic.

Watch the truth here advocated by tens of thousands of world-renowned scientists, medical professionals and epidemiologists
.

People of Singapore have to start waking up and question the Singapore government using junk science NPIs to hold the public accountable for any clusters.

What the world needs to do is focused protection, not “shut the whole world” hysterical strategy which does more harm than good.

1. Identify the high risk individuals (with hypertension, diabetes, etc) within the hospitals and care and nursing homes.

2. Assign staff who is regularly tested for covid to these high risk group (vaccinated staff does not cut it as vaccination does not prevent infection as shown in recent cases).

3. If you are a family member taking care of a vulnerable at home, you should go for regular testing as well.

This focused protection strategy is endorsed by tens of thousands of epidemiologists
, scientists and medical professionals.

This strategy is much better than wasting time and resources on testing and restricting the healthy general public (which has 99.99% chance of survival) which has little to no impact on the vulnerable.

Last year the move to full HBL during circuit breaker period had proven in developing our students to be adaptable and nimble, to be more self-directed and independent learners. Of course it may cause inconvenience for some households which I believe our gov can assist them case by case but most families will adapt well from previous full HBL experiences."

5319,10158296119047900,"Was hoping for more clarity as to the rules.

For example, if I have a few children, can I go out with them together (eg to take them to school)? Or must we walk in pairs? (Ie one or more children will be left walking alone and unsupervised?)

Another example - can a family go somewhere in a car together? Again, if I drop my kids off at school, do I have to drive them there one by one so we will be in pairs at all times?

I am getting conflicting information from everyone because no one is clear on this.

It is ok for there to be restrictions, but perhaps, more thought could be given to the implementation.
How would a single parent with more than one child then manage? Should one child be left home unsupervised so they can be in “groups of 2”? Or should the children be allowed to go out on their own to get groceries? Or should the children not be allowed to approach their parent when out with him/her?"

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

https://

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

you must be 6,7 and 8 for the group)

2) I start hear a song in my head go like this...
🎶🎶
There was a time when people said that Singapore won’t make it, but we did~

There was a time when troubles seems too much for us to take, but we did~

By recall this lyrics and look at the pass events happen around, I believe we can overcome this IF every Singaporeans do their part."

5546,10158295629917900,"With this, CB will not be enough. A thorough lockdown with closure of borders is mandatory. Do not give the excuse it infringes on rights because if anyone wants it, join the grave first."
5547,10158295807327900,"Ok, All thanks to our million dollars elite task force."
5548,10158295618227900,"Fantastic. While the ppl in the country obeyed the strict measures (for some at the expense of their businesses, finances and mental health) , you keep on importing all the sohai cases. The gov has been reactionary and slow at taking preemptive measures. When asked if we should wear masks, initially they said no need only when you are sick. When the ppl ask the government to stop taking in flights from China and those who have been to China, they say don't be xenophobic. You would think that they would have learnt something, better to over prepare than to be ill prepared. But now with India, you danced around terms and now look what has happened. Its frustratingly stressful on health cares services and businesses and of course on society in the country on the whole."
5549,10158295676447900,"Stupid.

Did the infected went into ICU or even need hospital care ? Our most vulnerable and risk group did their vaccination for what?

What happened to our decision makers? Press the panic button under the slightness threat. In hokkien we say ""buay Jai"""
5550,10158295601597900,PAP 4G how many will get kick out from parliament during next general election ? Singaporeans don't like soccer team that keep scoring own goals.
5551,10158295575497900,See you imported so many cases from South Asia and now we Singapore residents are the one who suffered. Pis!!!
5552,10158295568212900,If only they tighten the rules on imports as quickly and strictly as on Singaporeans. Then we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place 🙄
5553,10158295793377900,"What is so important with the air travel from high risk region that that the gov is willing to risk it all and putting the whole country at stake. I think the people, the frontline and the victim of the circumstance need to know what are their sacrifices for."
5554,10158295599782900,I clap for you for making Singaporeans suffer again. Be it health or businesses. There goes our past reserves and you keep coming up with ideas to collect money from suffering Singaporeans
5555,10158295830382900,Should long time ago restrict people from visiting Changi airport to eat n shop there. Those got Nothing better to do don’t go Changi Airport & get infected.

5593,10158295626462900,"Could someone cut the salaries of 4G ministers for this gross oversight that made this new breach in pandemic prevention possible?

Citizens are not racist nor xenophobic when they tell you to suspend bringing people from countries with runaway infectious rates. It's common sense for the need in self preservation and preserving what little normality in society left.

Now everything seems gone to waste on top of additional financial burden for tax payers to tide over business entities that's affected by the latest change.

PS Sorry to doctors, nurses and other frontline staff. You've worked hard!"

5615,10158295852362900,"And once we all vaccinate there’ll still be imbeciles who will never cover when they cough and sneeze.. so masks will never go... all this rubbish started because of that unhygienic bunch anyway even with all their rich history and culture can’t muster the basic common sense to adhere to hygiene.

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later."

5743,10158295594487900,I seriously dunno why I’m laughing even tho situation in such bad shape. If garment taking too much risk and refusing to put Singaporean health as priority or is it the economic as priority ? Now still bringing in those foreign workers too work in BTO ? Or do u still need them to sweep the floor ? U reap what u sow. Now economic confirm will get even worse . Thanks you our wise ones.
5744,10158295585467900,Almost like a prelude to a CB. How did we come to this? My premonition about imported cases now becoming reality.
5745,10158295588182900,"If we can bend the curve this time again....can our govt pls listen to the ppl... Restrict boarder opening... Stop trying travel bubble, its a price too high to pay for when 'if' happens .... Pls learn, pls learn hard !"
5746,10158295613522900,"Dining-in is one of the riskiest activities for the spread of COVID.

It’s the right move to restrict it , if we restrict gyms.

We cannot close our borders. Just put in restrictions.

We have to vaccinate fast so we don’t have to keep restricting activities."
5747,10158295891087900,Why can't the govt sometime just listen to us... why must need to wait for the situation getting worst and bring us to this inconvenience and waste our effort to cooperation for the past few mth..
5748,10158295745237900,Very true we cannot close our border.... but we certainly can enforce Stricker restrictions 2 check especially some smart alec who luv 2 say I know wat 2 do. Ya. Wow
5749,10158295599122900,The SOP for swap test in GP clinic really not safe. Everyone sitting at the same area without disinfect one by one waiting for swap test. I just did the test at the corridor of one GP clinic without any cleaning protocol. Now worries being infected by others even though my test results is showing negative now.
5750,10158295626167900,Public transport also hard to maintain 1M distance.
5751,10158295689822900,"Same old story repeating itself like a broken record. The authorities never seem to listen to us citizens - our forewarnings, opinions, misgivings are all brushed aside or ignored. They knew the mayhem the virulent mutant strains were causing overseas. Yet, they continued to rest on their laurels. And then when things go wrong as they have now - we bear the consequences."
5752,10158295738737900,"We citizens have always done our part in social distancing. Has the Garment done their part? If so, why are we still having imported cases daily and where did the more deadly strain come from into Sg?
Accountability seems to be lacking from the top as always."
5753,10158295586302900,"GOV, dont be shy to go back to CB.. this is for the safety of your people! We have been keeping up but look at the current situation now."
5754,10158295761307900,Group sizes limited to 2 but schools and tuition centres are still open. Why is that still not being considered for home based learning.? Most schools have completed the mid-year tests and holidays are around the corner. Please consider closing the schools.
5755,10158295578962900,"PAP is failure govt to contain this virus..many naive citizen still ""PAP CAN"" YES YOUR ANSWER IS RIGHT ""PAP BOLEH"""
5756,10158295573222900,"Back to CB
How about MRT, Buses and workplace this places are covered"
5757,10158295583057900,Lockdown locals from visiting airport . Tighten up protocols for in coming flight. Got to be a win win situation for SG. Better be restriction now than be sorry for inaction.
5758,10158295581887900,Should have done this way earlier.. The rules keep changing.. Might as well back to Circuit Breaker.. Frontline drivers rejoice empty roads once again 😂😂
5759,10158295593747900,Told ya we are just going in circles. From a stringent cb implementation to phase 2 to relaxing the rules in phase 3. This will continue on so forth. We have done our part yet the government still with their stance about the borders. Frustrating!
5760,10158295593617900,Who to blame ? Local people ? Who suffer ?
5761,10158295652892900,"At least G realized the needs to control . Hopefully this will be the last Phase 1.5. From the looks of it , the peak is not here yet."
5762,10158295581412900,This government only knows to punish the local where keep importing the “FT”.
5763,10158295581562900,Thanks! And we re still having those from high risks countries coming in on daily basis.. We can achieve we can achieve!!
5764,10158296119047900,"Was hoping for more clarity as to the rules.

For example, if I have a few children, can I go out with them together (eg to take them to school)? Or must we walk in pairs? (Ie one or more children will be left walking alone and unsupervised?)

Another example - can a family go somewhere in a car together? Again, if I drop my kids off at school, do I have to drive them there one by one so we will be in pairs at all times?

I am getting conflicting information from everyone because no one is clear on this.

It is ok for there to be restrictions, but perhaps, more thought could be given to the implementation.
How would a single parent with more than one child then manage? Should one child be left home unsupervised so they can be in “groups of 2”? Or should the children be allowed to go out on their own to get groceries? Or should the children not be allowed to approach their parent when out with him/her?"
5765,10158295577067900,Act decisively to disrupt virus transmission? I lost track how many time people have feedback to act earlier 😔
5766,10158295578917900,schools should consider hbl immediately to prevent more cases
5767,10158295593457900,K. But I hope they’ll stop this narrative of asking citizens to do their part and what’s not. We all know where this came from……
5768,10158295759807900,"Please allowed one person dine in (& safe distancing)🙏🙏🙏
I m working 14 hrs, at least must hv one meal, think many same situation...
Please not back to picnic at staircase, open space etc again like previously😢😭"
5769,10158295585517900,I blame gahmen for not closing the borders to high risk countries. Now we citizens have to suffer. Thank you no point cry amma appa no use nobody can help liao
5770,10158295592742900,"While no restrictions on public transport, singaporepools and imports from high risk countries, this gov really does a great job... at screwing people🤣"

5772,10158295573892900,Only know how to bully locals
5773,10158295637722900,"how about your public transport...eve
ryday thousand of peoples squeeze in the mrt and bus but you all just close the eye due to making alot of money from it...open all your eyes and come down to take the public transport during peak hour like a public without any security around to cover...."
5774,10158295586482900,How about public transport e.g. MRT can capped at 2 person per train?
5775,10158295600712900,What happens to our FDW on their off days? How are they able to eat? Genuine question 🌻
5776,10158295589127900,Might as well go circuit breaker. This is as good as circuit breaker already!
5777,10158295585792900,"We are getting hurt by ur open leg policy and now we have to bear the pain,might as well CB la,dont punish us by slow death"
5778,10158295611087900,So end up we law abiding citizens got Inconvenience again due to our imported cases 🙂
5779,10158295625747900,"There we go again, whole nation affected cause of some peoples irresponsible acts. Jus stop already."
5780,10158295584762900,"All because we keep letting in the sg/pr/ pass holders going back and forth from sg to india all along until recently and not raising the SHN to 21 days much earlier. The chain of transmission from those arrivals probably were already long transmitted to the community, spread wider and deeper already
No different like CB now"
5781,10158295573672900,So the foodcourt or restaurant will be full this 2 days...last dinning 🤭
5782,10158295593867900,Some SME employers still require staff to come to office to work everyday. Any checking from government on this?

SUCKS‼️😤"
5792,10158295569392900,"Alamak
You dun control airport properly
Now everyone suffer
I dun understand why you go visit airport for what knowing there are imported cases and this place is the frontline
I have never visited airport since the start of jan 2020
You work there of course people understand
You should not allow dine in at airports
Dabao ok
You should restrict people going to airport or at least dun allow them to dine in as you are figuring out how virulent this viruses are
The latest being b1617 variant
If you dun even have courage to anticipate simulate and have confidence to say this is right and scared of backlash
Now isn’t it worse"

5794,10158295661797900,"It's a mini CB we are entering now, caused by the folly of opening our borders to South Asia when other countries are closing theirs to these high risk countries. Let's prepare ourselves for the real CB."

most important thing is stay safe...."
5796,10158295863082900,"Calvin Cheng if you are a restaurant owner or worker, PHV or taxi driver I reckon you will think differently, so please spare a thought for the livelihoods of these categories of people, look the wearing masks, keeping a safe distance & avoid crowded place & even reduce social interaction are what we have already been doing as law abiding citizens, & as part of our collective responsibilitie
s including our personal responsibilitie
s as an individuals, even the practicing of good hygienic habits, but however the relevant authority must also diligently do their part to prevent more imported cases from coming in, there is no point if we only enforced strict control & discipline on ourselves which would all be futile if the authorities still open our doors so wide to risky foreigners who keep coming in & causing the number of our imported cases here to rise & spread !"
5797,10158295977797900,Genuine question : does a family of 4 count as a social group exceeding 2? Meaning is it possible for both parents sending 2 kids for enrichment classes on a weekend?
5798,10158295587717900,well it is not a surprise yeah? cases now detected in schools! worse than CB period. this is really CB liao

5803,10158295806762900,“We need to act decisively to disrupt the virus transmission. We will therefore further tighten safe management measures in the community” Did you act decisively? You only follow suit after Hong Kong ban all arrivals from India. You need to wake up and realign your objectives. Is getting local Singapreans back on track and businesses going more essential or your lame reasons such as delay in BTO more important. Don't try to be smug and open the borders in the face of this pandemic. If you are so good at following others then take a cue from Australia. You need to open the borders but not now !
5804,10158295593982900,Do you limit delivery or maintanance personnel going multiple location too?
5805,10158295599252900,"Tighten restrictions ppl complain, loosen restrictions ppl complain, tighten border control ppl complain, loosen border control ppl complain. Everthing oso complain, everyhing oso govt's fault. I wonder if ppl blame govt if they constipate."

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

https://

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

While the ppl in the country obeyed the strict measures (for some at the expense of their businesses, finances and mental health) , you keep on importing all the sohai cases. The gov has been reactionary and slow at taking preemptive measures. When asked if we should wear masks, initially they said no need only when you are sick. When the ppl ask the government to stop taking in flights from China and those who have been to China, they say don't be xenophobic. You would think that they would have learnt something, better to over prepare than to be ill prepared. But now with India, you danced around terms and now look what has happened. Its frustratingly stressful on health cares services and businesses and of course on society in the country on the whole."

Citizens are not racist nor xenophobic when they tell you to suspend bringing people from countries with runaway infectious rates. It's common sense for the need in self preservation and preserving what little normality in society left.

Now everything seems gone to waste on top of additional financial burden for tax payers to tide over business entities that's affected by the latest change.

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later."

In early May, everyone was urged to use up their Rediscover vouchers by end June (before the announcement of extension to Dec)....many of us (I know of friends and family members) had made bookings for staycays or group outings which have a clause that bookings made with Rediscover vouchers cannot be cancelled or changed or face forfeit of entire amount. We maybe a small proportion of the cohort, but if dine in etc is restricted, can you please at least loosen these Rediscover vouchers clauses at hotels and venues etc, so that we don't end up serving a ""SHN-staycay"" in a hotel or losing the full amount of our payment? We can't dine out, so what is the point of a staycay? I'd much rather be really staying home then and without being penalised for something out of my control. Please consider these circumstances and not deal out piecemeal restrictions like this? It's highly destabilising."

6253,10157899921427100,"Thank you TASK TEAM for being so FAST in imposing the near back to CCB 1 stage!

I strongly support your mandate we rather control the EASY local residents, make all local business stop, all restaurants with no in-house guests, than temporally stopping the influx of people from those High Risk countries.
They are much more important and will be detrimental to our economy if we stop them from coming in, we can live without local business, but not without them!!

I support you, because you may have to dig your piggy bank and give us $$ again!"

Sorry to say that my call to MoH has confirmed that this statement is not true. MOH staff said that it does not require the care to be on a daily basis. Also that no other visitors are allowed if the grandparents are in the house.

However, a call to ST for clarification gave a different version. ST staff said that "" on a daily basis"" refers to living together with grandchildren, thus not part of the quota of 2 visitors per day.

Could MoH and ST please be more explicit and explain clearly what the restriction for grandparents is about? The current statements by both sides are very confusing."
6265,829498527986731,Omg! The wave has returned back. We have to bear the consequences for your mistakes! Why can't you all just simply close the border earlier? Really backside itchy。。。

6270,10157899906332100,"I would suggest suspension Of all school, enrichment, co curricular and tuition classes temporarily for a month to Ensure that the virus doesn’t spread further.

The virus spreads easily among kids as they attend multiple classes and activities across Singapore in a day, coming into contact with more people than an average adult would.

These kids are our future. If they go down, there’ll be no future for our country.

May I suggest an islandwide circuit breaker for all students temporarily; for schools, tuition and enrichment centres, till we are cleared of this new variant, or till everyone is vaccinated. Education can still continue through online classes.

If it worsens, we can consider an islandwide circuit breaker for adults too.

Help to repost this so this message reaches more parents/people in position to save our kids.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

6459,1439099676444270,The India variant has been alerted way back in Dec. Being the task force you guys should have study it very closely and prepare for alternative of hiring foreign workers from other less risk countries. Shut borders to India was the most logical common sense to do it for the sake of the citizens. Instead you keep opening border to India thinking that you can manage the risk. Did you even study the India variant itself? How infectious is it?? You sacrifice the whole population for the sake of not delaying projects without the initiative to find other foreign workers. Now many sectors have to close because of your lack of anticipation and poor management. In the end we suffer both - in health and in finance

6494,10157899803637100,What's the point for us to comply to all the rules! Most Singaporeans have done our part and comply to all guidelines unlike other countries. Yet keep on importing and importing! Now we have to deal with the consequences!
6495,10157899820392100,Its Easy. STOP IMPORTING. We Singaporean have done our part & now all our affort gone to drain.
6496,10157899816842100,I hope every single Singaporean knows which ‘shithole country’ was the one which created this B1617 mess.

6508,10157899834242100,This time India must be made to accountable for exporting this Indian variant to many places around the world in particular around Asia and Modi must offer one of the most sincere and the deepest of apologies via TV and Social Media and take full responsibility by step down from the post immediately after that
6509,10157899805977100,"Wah Hor Say Liow!! Many Singaporean already knew this will happen. Beg them not to import but yet they don't gv a damp! Now see what happen. Someone need to be held responsible and answer for it. Why shd we suffer because of them. Only one word to say. X#&%@¶¿ As I said before, we will be 2nd India if still carry on importing. Well import more! we will be there sooner than expected. Yes we need them to build, we need them for this & that. Maybe you forgot to mentioned we need them to destroy our peaceful prosperous country."

The border continues to be opened. Anyway, it's too late. Thanks to your arrogance, incompetence, incapabilities,

Back in the day nobody would get tested for a flu and report there was 367 cases today up 17 from the previous day etc... you moronically test anybody for any illness on a certain day and you’ll find some problem or the other - just another route to misunderstandin
g humanity, turning everyone into robots... this lunacy will never end.

Adapt, adjust and move on.

How is anyone gonna progress if every time there’s a remote case of a flu everybody’s got to stay locked in.

HOAX."

6532,10157899898522100,this time is really on the govt... the task force and their useless risk-based approach and ZERO foresight for not tightening the border restrictions when its soo blatantly obvious that it was a ticking time bomb for community spread and now when sh-t hits the fans they are punishing the ppl and restricting them when they all along have been adhering to the restrictions.. do they know that singapore is able to come this far cos we operate on foresight and not on risk-based approach.. at this rate im scared for singapore being in the hands of these so called 4G leaders

6566,3987369298019220,"And once we all vaccinate there’ll still be imbeciles who will never cover when they cough and sneeze.. so masks will never go... all this rubbish started because of that unhygienic bunch anyway even with all their rich history and culture can’t muster the basic common sense to adhere to hygiene.

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later."
6567,3987366048019550,"COVID IS JUST THE TIPPING POINT CAUSING MASS DEATHS

Each and every organ in our body is already very weakened and severely underperforming
due to the contaminated air, food, water, mind, etc. as follows. So our bodies are the ideal places for any virus or disease to easily finish whatever meager health is remaining in our bodies and thus kill us within no time. But still we don't want to give up the below 7 killers of ours. We are just trying to patch up the symptoms when it is already too late while totally ignoring the following root causes of it all.

1. So much pollution in the air which we take in into our lungs every single day in massive proportions.

2. All the pesticides and other dosha-imbalanci
ng items in our food which are eating us up from within day after day.

3. All the artificial and poisonous chemical medicines, drugs, steroids, opioids, etc. which we have dumped into our bodies for decades and thus totally destroyed our own immune system and resistance power totally.

4. All the carcinogenic electromanetic,
radio frequency, etc. radiations and the mental junk and fantasies which all our bodily organs and mind are being constantly microwaved with in this technological age.

5. Mass-scale hatred and violence being inflicted on each other at the drop of the hat.

6. Nature's fury in the name of natural calamities because we are so cruelly exploiting nature to the very hilt for our own greedy and selfish ends.

7, And finally our toxic lust which we indulge in regularly causing the colossal loss and depletion of our seventh dhatu, the very essence of all what we eat, drink, and breathe. This renders all our other 6 dhatus (plasma, blood, muscle, adipose, bones, and marrow) weak and our immune system extremely susceptible to the slightest disease. The animals which engage in the most lust have the shortest lifespans and those who engage the least in lust have the longest lifespans. patanam bindu maranat, rakshanam bindu jivanat.

These 7 are the precise reasons why Srimad Bhagavatam states that people will literally become like dwarfs in primitive villages massacred by their cruel monarchical rulers and eventually live only for a maximum of 15 years as Kaliyuga progresses and ends after 427,000 years. kamala jala dala, jivana talamala, chapala sukha laba lagi re..."

It’s the right move to restrict it , if we restrict gyms.

We cannot close our borders. Just put in more restrictions.

If tomorrow big crowds gather in groups of 5 to eat together and bring children and family to public places and places of interest, won't there be continued spreading?
And worse is if lots of people decide to gather in big group for one last hurrah tomorrow night. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄

What is task force thinking?
Will give them benefit of the doubt.
Will like to think that they are giving businesses enough time to prepare the things required. Like ordering huge amounts if takeaway plastics and boxes, and for all businesses to inform and cancel all classes like yoga and outdoor exercises groups.

Keep safe, everyone!"
6753,10157899936137100,"I do not understand how someone can keep saying ""we cannot close borders""...what
nonsense...it is precisely this sort of attitude that cause this second wave...see what is happening at changi airport..."
6754,10157899929217100,Everything is tighten BUT not shutting down border for 1 mth! Whats the point!
6755,10157900008357100,Is this a circuit breaker in disguise phase? 70% similar to CB except borders not closed. A small CB
6756,10157899955662100,"Some people managed to save their loved ones from a crises back home. And I am glad for them, as a fellow human being. But some people here (and their loved ones) have fallen just because they happened to be trying to keep Singapore safe.

Sigh...."
6757,10157899929412100,Pls close schools immediately. We have been preparing for HBL. Time to move into HBL now.
6758,10157899976482100,"Sudden extreme cut to only 2 pax social gathering. Will we see a spike these 2 nights for gathering and party? Pubs, KTV etc have to close also probably if no dine in allowed."
6759,10157900534957100,"So essential workers who don't have a place to eat have to hide again? Not every essential worker work as food delivery, taxi driver etc who can show evidence as essential worker. Some companies don't provide a place to eat in.

During the circuit breaker I had to hide either at the staircase to eat or drink since my job requires me to go different places daily."
6760,10157900620887100,"Would love for some experts and economists to calculate the gains from keeping the borders open to the highly infected countries.
Vs the financial losses and social costs from having these community infections, stresses to the healthcare system, contact tracing, and disruption to businesses"

6762,10157899945232100,If only listen abd close borders this will not have to happen. Why cant they learn from the past and other countries
6763,10157899986532100,Thank thank you we are back at square one after months of hard work and suffering. Now many many more business will suffer and many many people will be out of job again. Thank you thank you to who ever they are. All efforts wasted.
6764,10157899952032100,"People have been asking to close the borders to those who are from high risk countries but it has fallen on deaf ears or with the reply that we cannot close our borders. Hey! Not asking you to close totally, high risk countries, got it? Obviously not. And now we are back to where we were one year ago..."
6765,10157899925602100,Does this apply to families as well? Cannot be out with 2 parents and 2 children at the same time?
6766,10157899901792100,"So sad.
Back to square one after so many imported cases.
New virus from India B1617.

Even pre-check or without and cap at 50 ppl isn’t it still on risks?
Ppl inside still will remove masks and eat, drinks"
6768,10157900079337100,Of course la. I change car want to apply also reject 9 times. Ask some paper i dont have. Then expect me bring my mum down. Go out only spend then leave me hanging. What this worker doing talking online and email and needing to ask them when you can call or video call. Make me shop unecessarily. Please improve the system
6769,10157899921757100,Should close all schools too.
6770,10157899901562100,"Is this CB2? I am v.confused from the article, cannot go work but can go out for entertainment but cap at 25%?"
6771,10157899897282100,"It is immensely frustrating seeing many other countries slowly getting back to some semblance of normalcy, but here we are (in the so-called best place in the world to be during Covid) now subject to a second lockdown, still under virtually the same restrictions as last April. Especially given that the vast majority of Singaporeans have unquestioningly
accepted and adhered to whatever restrictions and measures that were imposed on us for more than a year.

Who is responsible for being in bed with corporations and refusing to implement a permanent work from home arrangement, but instead force the working class back to the office, resulting in dozens of strangers being jam-packed into every single mrt carriage on the way to school and work during peak hours every day?

Who is responsible for making this country's economy a sham entirely reliant on unsustainable population growth, exploitation of cheap foreign labour, and being a prostitute to foreign capital, such that we have no choice but to continue an open-door import policy in the midst of a pandemic?

I'm so sick and tired of ordinary Singaporeans having to bear responsibility and having to pay the price for the mistakes of our so-called elite leadership."
6772,10157899895077100,"Also, can you also help, what if I have staycays during that period and I paid with SRV and wanna cancel it, can someone enlighten me? I think it's only fair you can refund us the SRVs used. If can that'll be great! Thanks!!"

6775,10157899989752100,Hope they are also looking at non-essential travelling out and back to Spore especially from areas with high number of covid cases and deaths ...
6776,10157899900292100,"Stay strong. Love from Malaysian, who has just gone into full lockdown about a week ago.💪💪"
6777,10157899899512100,"See la busy open border. Dun come and blame us pls, just admit your wrong doing, my dear minister and government department.. the citizen of Singapore play their part!"
6778,10157899964447100,"Students still go school but adults stay at home.
Yoga studios open, but gym close.

What logic?"
6779,10157899907162100,Poor judgement to let travellers from high risk countries lead us to this scenario. Why didn't ban them from entering 2 or 3 months ago ? Why such a huge oversight ?
6780,10157899921892100,What fancy new name they have for this ? Circuit breaker Lite ?
6781,10157899895712100,Let' s name a cat a cat please. Just simply a new lock down. Why not using the right words?

6784,10157899901352100,One most important restriction still not impose yet . It's mandatory to maintain complete silence.. no talking among each other or on the mobile phone.. 😬🤭😁
6785,10157899901807100,We have all been v good !! With such a small population sorry to say we are risking all of our lives . Millions already mentioned PLS STOP allowing people to Spore . For whatever reason ! Afraid it’s a lil’ too late now . . Gdluck to all Sporean
6786,10157899897722100,Why mess about with SMM than ramp up vaccinations? There are more administrators at the vaccine centres than people getting vaccinated. We are damn slow...
6787,10157899910352100,Is Cruise holiday affected? What abt SRV trip which involve lunch or dinner?
6788,10157899933482100,Pub and Bistro still can open??? Hope also close as its high risk area too
6789,10157899914087100,Should ban imported cases not ban this type of rules we didnt make it the outbreak to happen its its the imported cases. Its not fair ok !
6790,10157899986082100,its certainly a 2nd Circuit Breaker ! but so ' how lian ' refuse to call it so ?
6791,10157899906632100,"Whoever is responsible for such repercussions, please step down🙄
One step forward, 2 steps back."

6793,10157899893912100,The authorities will conduct a review 2 weeks after May 16 to see if measures need to be adjusted further😓😓😓😓😓looking very gloomy 😥😥
6794,10157899900487100,No need review la... just open up everything... the wider the better‼️
6795,10157899898727100,"Only Group of 2 person allowed. Make me laugh. Just declare CB 2.0 lah. It's your fault, admit it"
6796,10157899897887100,how about cruise to nowhere? still can sail?
6797,10157899897837100,All introverts: *internal screaming* YESSSSS
6798,10157899899957100,Actually should not let any travelling
6799,10157899895872100,"C Bei Jialat .....now ? more Jialat coming.........
give us MONEY to buy food to eat and stay at home ?"
6800,10157899929207100,"Dining-in is one of the riskiest activities for the spread of COVID.

We have to vaccinate fast so we don’t have to keep restricting activities."
6801,10157900090667100,"Basically, ask we all to take cover and go for shelter. while they import many import cases. They prefer us to hide yourself, rather than close border. Do you see the picture here"
6802,10157899980562100,Wonder if there is any 75% JSS for those affected businesses
6803,10157899900367100,then can spas still operate?
6804,10157900379217100,Dont think all employers will adhere to this WFH ruling. They will still insists their employees to come to office even though can WFH
6805,10157901879387100,The obvious way was shut the gate for time being....and block knon cases coming in ..obviously gov not listen and thereare still fake entries...
6806,10157900256692100,"Failed job. Period.

Allowing contagious travellers to enter Singapore -> increase chances that airport staff will be infected -> allowing staff working in contagious area to eat in the food court for the public -> public gets infected -> starts spreading in the community.

Allowing Ministers to rotate in different ministries when they have not even settle down and know what they need to know.

Failed at various levels."
6807,10157900158377100,So if company dont allow WFH can we report them?
6808,10157900071737100,"Qn, is toddler below 2 years considered 1 pax?"
6809,10157900127072100,"Well done Singapore, this is a good move. Unlike us here in Malaysia, cases are crazy on a daily basis and community cases is increasing by day, especially with the new Variant found here it makes it worse for us but the government is still so relax 😂 We pray for everyone in Singapore to be safe and may we will all be reunited there as my family members are there ❤️"

6824,10157900794067100,"Honestly, very tired of listening to all theses ever revising measures. Lockdown say Lockdown la, why so kuniang chut so many patterns??? Everyday got new measures you think we all so free to keep following your ever revising measures ah??? Or isit becoz you earlier last week you say that CB unlikely, then now cases shot up liao you scared malu so avoid using the CB term isit??? .

6836,10157899948157100,"Basically they just lost control, then panic and clueless what to do.
We can never have a sustainable phase 3 if we continue to be so lax on the border restrictions. It will always be community spread, contain, control then imported cases and back to CB/phase 2.
Expected this the moment they announced back to phase 2 less than 2 weeks ago. We do not have a confident Taskforce team who can effectively deal with the situation and the people / business are made to suffer because of the inept handling."

To put things in perspective, New York City has a land mass of 468.19 sq mi, a population of 8.4 million and a daily average of 648 Covid cases.

6953,10158295689822900,"Same old story repeating itself like a broken record.

6954,10158295738737900,"We citizens have always done our part in social distancing. Has the Garment done their part? If so, why are we still having imported cases daily and where did the more deadly strain come from into Sg?

6961,10158295593747900,Told ya we are just going in circles. From a stringent cb implementation to phase 2 to relaxing the rules in phase 3. This will continue on so forth. We have done our part yet the government still with their stance about the borders. Frustrating!

6966,10158296119047900,"Was hoping for more clarity as to the rules.

For example, if I have a few children, can I go out with them together (eg to take them to school)? Or must we walk in pairs? (Ie one or more children will be left walking alone and unsupervised?)

Another example - can a family go somewhere in a car together? Again, if I drop my kids off at school, do I have to drive them there one by one so we will be in pairs at all times?

I am getting conflicting information from everyone because no one is clear on this.

It is ok for there to be restrictions, but perhaps, more thought could be given to the implementation.
How would a single parent with more than one child then manage? Should one child be left home unsupervised so they can be in “groups of 2”? Or should the children be allowed to go out on their own to get groceries? Or should the children not be allowed to approach their parent when out with him/her?"
6967,10158295577067900,Act decisively to disrupt virus transmission? I lost track how many time people have feedback to act earlier 😔

s including our personal responsibilitie
s as an individuals, even the practicing of good hygienic habits, but however the relevant authority must also diligently do their part to prevent more imported cases from coming in, there is no point if we only enforced strict control & discipline on ourselves which would all be futile if the authorities still open our doors so wide to risky foreigners who keep coming in & causing the number of our imported cases here to rise & spread !"

You only follow suit after Hong Kong ban all arrivals from India. You need to wake up and realign your objectives. Is getting local Singapreans back on track and businesses going more essential or your lame reasons such as delay in BTO more important.

The govt and scientists all blamed the nation for misbehaving but no one dare to suspect and question the common denominator:

All these places have the most vaccinated people!

It is a scientific fallacy and against virology 101 to think that mutations are imported and cannot happen locally due to the artificial suppressions (like lockdown of healthy population and vaccines) used on the population. Suppression (esp using vaccines on a large scale basis during a pandemic) is associated with increased virus mutation and escape. This is seen in many countries which started vaccination.

Rising trend of deaths and cases worldwide in countries with increased vaxxcination (with detailed analysis at the end that this is probably not due to seasonality).

Is the most dreaded ADE (Antibodies dependent enhancement) effect kicking in?

Not surprised that SG is starting to see more cases of vaxxinated getting covid.

Of course correlation does not mean causation but this worrying trend definitely warrants immediate halt to vaccination and further investigation.

7195,10158295618227900,"Fantastic. While the ppl in the country obeyed the strict measures (for some at the expense of their businesses, finances and mental health) , you keep on importing all the sohai cases. The gov has been reactionary and slow at taking preemptive measures. When asked if we should wear masks, initially they said no need only when you are sick. When the ppl ask the government to stop taking in flights from China and those who have been to China, they say don't be xenophobic. You would think that they would have learnt something, better to over prepare than to be ill prepared. But now with India, you danced around terms and now look what has happened. Its frustratingly stressful on health cares services and businesses and of course on society in the country on the whole."
7196,10158295676447900,"Stupid.

Did the infected went into ICU or even need hospital care ? Our most vulnerable and risk group did their vaccination for what?

Citizens are not racist nor xenophobic when they tell you to suspend bringing people from countries with runaway infectious rates. It's common sense for the need in self preservation and preserving what little normality in society left.

This is the same reason why students since primary school inception until now will never learn because when they see their parents coughing and sneezing at each other like it’s normal, these same stupid kids do that to other students in school. This is why it’ll never end no matter what the government does.

Get on with life normally - back in the day there were similar issues but no testing because even the healthiest of people on any given day can test positive then negative over an amplified flu.

This is complete lunacy at its highest level. Just live with common sense, basic manners and hygiene and everything and everyone will adapt accordingly. Closing everything is never a long term solution, all it does if bring about more pent up defiance later."

7391,10157900859827100,"From the list of places, there are 2 other tuition centres visited by confimed cases. Hopefully no other students from these tuition centres get infected.😥"
7392,10157902064232100,"Just conduct HBL for next 2 weeks then let the kids and teacher hv some breather during the June sch holidays. Stay home,stay safe."
7393,10157901617042100,"""while students must maintain safe distancing of at least one metre from others and refrain from interacting."" Think teachers shouldn't allow group work or discussion. If possible minimize pair work too..as children tend to talk too much with masks not properly worn.."
7394,10157901785607100,"I believe some parents would want the Gov to make it mandatory for all tuition centres, enrichment/
private tuitions to move lessons online.
We know that nothing is for sure because the world had yet fully understand this COVID-19 and it’s new variants at this stage, the Gov need to take actions soonest in this matter before our situation turn worse🙏 Thank you"
7395,10157901351502100,I am concerned how will the school conduct PE lessons from 16May? My child told me that they are playing games in groups with masks taken out currently. How to have safe distancing when their PE lessons are conducted this way? It is just loopholes with MOE's planning.
7396,10157900975497100,Bring schools holiday forward and keep the kids safe now community too many cases
7397,10157901485802100,"The Straits Times I’m angered by two recent ST headlines about how teachers must wear masks and how schools must have fixed seating! What do you think schools have been doing until now? All our SMM efforts for the past year have become rubbish thanks to ST, with all the worried parents and keyboard warriors now unloading their panic onto this perceived lack of SMM in schools! Unbelievable!"
7398,10157900898867100,"I’m surprised at home many comments asking sch to close now. For primary school going kids, you as parents would know that not all schools have finished WA. (You would have known what WA means if you have pri sch gg kids)"
7399,10157901357837100,"They still mingle during their PE lessons with their masks off 🤦🏻‍♀️

Be proactive leaders not reactive lah. Left 2 more weeks before June holidays, might as well close all the schools before more students are infected!"
7400,10157903799542100,"Gov took latest actions and only allows 2 pax being together but have kids running around schools and allow mamy kids to be in same classroom regardless of the 1 M social distancing. This is absurb. Close school earlier and avoid more future pains if kids get infected. Children are playful by nature, how to control all of them at same time? And teachers will have a hard time teaching with mask on the whole session. They have to talk or at times talk very loudly, alot of saliva will spill onto their own mask. Unless school provides mutiple change of masks for teacher per day, it will be a hard time for teacher which will ultimately affects the young learners."
7401,10157901740657100,"Be truth and honest! Anybody went to T3 or close related to T3 workers should self quarantine and look after your own health condition. This will help to stop virus spreading. Even though you did not receive SHN yet your family is one of the SHN related, please stay at home"
7402,10157901921277100,CCA should be cancel. I don't think it important than health.
7403,10157902038782100,"Anyway to find out how many imported cases and community cases? And any website to check for those daily imported cases, and what are they? Meaning citizens, PRS, dependents etc? I m just curious not asking for trouble"
7404,10157901531177100,"Seriously makes no sense by letting the school to operate as per normal at current situation. Keeping them 1m apart doesn’t bring them safe too. Some lower primary children don’t handle their mask well.

Please don’t repeat the same mistake."
7405,10157901415882100,Biggest joke. You pack the classes so tight n refuse to reduce number per class and expect 1m distancing. Impossible task. The physical space even on paper cannot work.
7406,10157901050962100,Should start HBL by now instead of all the measures since exposure to infection is still at high risk. Be responsible...
7407,10157901282797100,"For the safety of all students, bring the June holidays forward!"
7408,10157903995547100,Fantastic! Im sure we will win the world cup when we conduct soccer lessons online!
7409,10157900989912100,"Give the kids pre-order menu for recess. Serve their food in classroom so that its fixed seating n no mingling.. Just like airplane service.. Deploy ex-stewardess to serve the food of choice during recess..

1st no mingling during recess.. 2nd, can polish the air stewardess's skill.. To keep them ever ready to serve. 😂"
7410,10157901922117100,How about 1 to 1 home tuition?
7411,10157901942412100,Students in primary school are exempted from returning their plates/trays after eating and can leave it on the table for the cleaners to clear. 😅
7412,10157901348662100,When your businesses suffer and results suffer. When we spend another 100 billion reserves. Remember they refuse to ban flights from one single country but rather lock down whole country
7413,10157901316287100,"Please don't wait for evidence to close schools, it will be too late. And don't forget that we have a group of vulnerable people who still attending the schools and centers that can't comply with the safety measures, even can't put on masks. Want to wait and see or stop now."
7414,10157901481862100,"School can do 30 to 40 a class.
Enrichment centres can't do 10.

The logic jump..."
7415,10157900938397100,Teachers are going to need extra pairs of eyes on the back of their heads so that they can see everything when their backs are turned to the children! 😑
7416,10157901030037100,Students from IHL shouldn't return to schools when no dining in is allowed. It makes no sense that they couldn't eat properly even if they could do takeaways. Exception is made for MOE schools but their term will close in 2 weeks time. Policies sometime are contradictory and not properly thought through.
7417,10157901703527100,Protect our children by Moving the student to e-learning @ this critical period is the wise choice where we have no control the source of virus.

7419,10157901031992100,Just shut the schools and conduct HBL till June holidays. Stop more schools getting infected.
7420,10157901001062100,"Pls shut the schools, it's coming June holidays anyway. Their lives are not worth a few weeks of study"

7422,10157900844497100,What’s the fun of recess with fixed seating? Recess is meant for naughty boys to run around with friends and with a soccer ball! No fun at all!
7423,10157904452532100,No dine in< what about students having recess ? can dine in at canteen ?
7424,10157901411682100,Fundamental question is that Dining-in is not allowed at all eateries n restaurants but why school's canteen can be allowed for students to dine-in????
7425,10157902247812100,After everything under control and traced than start sch again..
7426,10157901922547100,"No logic, must HBL for all students."
7427,10157901155912100,"Those students who bring food from home, let them eat in the classroom, so more space in the canteen."
7428,10157901358402100,Should start HBL
7429,10157901800492100,How about those PE lessons for these students?🤔

Sure 2-passengers measures and restrictions for taxi/grab, wouldn't the incumbents put the taxi / grab drivers in the prospect of losing their livelihoods.

[The restriction does not apply to passengers from the same household. For example, a parent can travel with his or her two children if they live together, LTA said.]

{We recognise that there may be occasions where members of the same household may need to move about in groups larger than two persons, especially those with young children or elderly parents in order to look after their higher care needs. These may include taking public transport, going for medical appointments, attending classes or going to work in the same vehicle. We are prepared to be flexible in our implementation of the general rule for such bonafide cases.

How long are you willing to wait for your turn to board the bus? Are you willing to walk to your destinations daily if you don't get an empty bus after 1 hour of waiting?then later you complain say bus service no good.

7679,10158301125052900,Aiyo! Poor thing! I prefer my 3 kids to be in school. Maybe not very convenient if parents hv to WFH and kids hv to do HBL at the same time? And kids have to have their outside time too? Good for their development. Now so restrictive again. I was so happy when I thought that SG is going to open up but now back to square one or even 1 step back from square 1?
7680,10158300680837900,Great. MMTF finally acknowledges that this variant is quite virulent and closing the schools is necessary.
7681,10158300754597900,"Please, people. Can be reasonable??? Do also die, don't do also die.
There are people who want schools to open and some who want schools to close.
Preschool children are young and will require care. Don't just think of yourselves. If their parents are both essential workers and could not afford a helper, then who is going to take care of their kids? Not everyone is so lucky to stay home, ok??? You are encouraged NOT to send your children to preschool, but please leave a road for the ones who need the service!"
7682,10158300738152900,"Is a right step to take. However, we must be mindful of the more venerable children with complicated family where school setting is a better environment for their learning and building of confident and character. Hope social services efforts increase to look out for these."
7683,10158300685097900,"It takes 7 primary schools and 11 students to finally bring schools to a halt and carry on with HBL, which is a far safer option than being on site in school.

Schools are never a safer option compared to homes due to the enlarged and enclosed areas where the students are held. Just look at the canteens, no matter how stringent the covid-19 measures are, especially with the double mutated strains, covid-19 will certainly prevail among our young ones."
7684,10158300716277900,"So.. The signal is very clear already.. After that we will back to last Yr CB.. Because parents will need to take care of the kids..
Let's hope this move will contain the virus and eveyone do our parts to make everyone safe.. 💖✌️"
7685,10158300719912900,"Partial closures, moving to HBL, Work from home and all sorts of requirements do nothing but complicate daily lives and activities. There is a need for us to be proactive rather than being reactive. All these temporary measures might help in the short term but learning from our past migrant worker dormitory outbreak experience, I find there is an urgent need to shutdown completely for 2-3 weeks. We have to do this now before the case numbers spike in hundreds. At that point, HBL, Work from home, MOH coming to pick up suspected cases and sending to hotels for quarantines and such, none of this will remain sustainable or effective. Closures of course will call for government support which seems to be lacking with current measures. All businesses will suffer during this time. I believe people will accept closing down for 2-3 weeks completely and receive some form of government support to tide over this period rather than staying open but with a list of things “not to do” and take another deep financial hit. We can use this 2-3 weeks of closure to create a world record of fastest vaccination drive in a country. Vaccinate every single one. May be.

7686,10158301704362900,"Can just cancel all the ongoing/
upcoming mid year exams and have a longer mid year school holiday? The simpler the arrangement is, the better for all. Lesser stress for all - parents, teachers and students."
7687,10158300779887900,"Still remain some rooms for those kids whose parents not able to offer HBL due to working or some special reasons, Schools still need to provide certain supports for the kind of families’ kids. 🙏"
7688,10158300686712900,"Pls let ur children stay home don't make noise because most of us will WFH so don't complain for pre sch still open but if u work from home try to let them at home unless under circumstances..
.please don't be an arrogant ppl"
7689,10158300702477900,"For young kids, personally think, they will be
TOO active at home. Their parents should
let them have a HOBBY, e.g. keeping PETS !!"
7690,10158300683262900,"Good. No romping in malls after school hours will cut down infection possibilities. And with parents working from home, it should remind parents who have forgotten Phase 1 what it was like working from home as well as keep them away from getting infected and spreading the virus during their lunch breaks at work."
7691,10158300735457900,Should close all borders. Putting pre school students and student care kids at more risk in this case.
7692,10158300682427900,"'Announcing this on Sunday, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said authorities understand that the shift to full home-based learning ""may cause anxiety in some parents""

U don't shift to home base then will cause anxiety to parent lo!"

the procedure,
preparation and detail.
Immediately, not logical.
You give a logical plan,
immediately."
7695,10158300685137900,good to protect the kids from covid
7696,10158300721782900,"Just close the borders!
What’s the point of restricting internally but still letting the imports in."
7697,10158300685572900,"It's now or never. Now that the viruses are spreading in the community, all schools should closed for the time being as our children are not vaccinated and it would be very risky to expose them to the risk out there now. Please stay home stay safe. Now this is not the time to gather and shopping in malls. We wouldn't want to return to Phrase 1 when we completely stop all activities and stay at home. Let us do our part and stop this spread together."
7698,10158300736412900,"Now talk about school .. what’s next... have the government look into day care centre for senior or waiting for another case to Happen? Really no one know.. just My thoughts...vacc
ination is not exlir... vaccines are developed as of earlier situation but now it have become different kind of variant as of now"
7699,10158300778032900,Wait.. affect younger children then y student care n preschool still can operate...? Another half baked policy
7700,10158300736527900,Close Preschools Too!!! They're younger and have poorer immune system
7701,10158300692147900,OMG! Why left the pre-schoolers to go school and the rest all HBL. Gov still think that pre-schoolers need to learn more then the rest?
7702,10158300694717900,"I wish Singapore can close all borders permanently till next year, just like Australia did."
7703,10158300752997900,How abt preschool teachers who have pri sch going kids ?
7704,10158300705747900,What's the logic? So many preschoolers attending extra enrichment too. They are not at risk too? Why they still need to go to school?
7705,10158300695647900,"Personally think The schools should start the SCHOOL
holidays earlier !! To avoid the crowds !!"
7706,10158300723817900,Why wait till Wednesday? You mean they have to choose a special date?
7707,10158300687872900,Its not unexpected and this time round at least CCS is doing it right unlike LW and OYK.
7708,10158300706032900,And whose fault is that again? For bringing in this more virulent strain??
7709,10158300690092900,Piecemeal measures ... still waiting for government to impose ban on receiving passengers from high risk regions.
7710,10158300705172900,"Still don understand why let so many indians come into Singapore when never heard of more Indians leaving sg so need replacement. Economy is slowing down. There aren't increased constructions or sudden extra cleaning work to do done and most dormitory worker from last year should be back to work by now. So why we need to get more fw in? Even maid has to come n go. We need more figures break down of who is coming in or leaving, the detail for more than 10k imported since april, how many are Ep, why they are approved to come in with their dependents and paid so high. Is really a bad impact to sg in the end if sg is locked down. The lost is greater then getting fw to come in since they don't generate income (other then one time quarantine or swap test income). Now making paranoid got to stay at home, avoid school n office, can't go shops or eat out. And this affect working parents a lot. Its super hard to work with kids around. Not declared a Cb so no subsidies to anyone, pte drivers/self employed or low income family who at first got meal help in sch?"
7711,10158300688907900,I just heard now parents are screaming and crying...
7712,10158300706382900,"How about staff working in preschools/
childcares? Childcare teachers with children in Primary/
Secondary Schools, who are the sole caregivers to these children, are unable to care for them and be at work at the same time. How are the Early Childhood Educators provided with support in this situation?"
7713,10158300713427900,"Yes, good decision, because the kids' Safety is more important than anything else!"
7714,10158300695687900,Power la CCS! I was just discussing this topic with children and the news came in. Thanks for understanding our anxiety as parent.👍👍👍
7715,10158300682032900,Why to start only on Wed?! It should be implemented immediately!! It’s not logical
7716,10158300738502900,Actually why don't just bring forward the school holidays like last year?
7717,10158300686777900,Good move. We cannot let undesired things get us down. We can achieve!
7718,10158300780202900,Every hour got changes... think we r so free ah need update ... minister so free is it... look like out of control
7719,10158300693567900,At least now reasonable reasoning come from him rather then cotton come from sheep.

7721,10158300690047900,"Still want poly students to go back for practicals and lab work, simply asking for trouble. Want to HBL then apply to everyone. Virus perhaps excused those going to polys."
7722,10158300678627900,This is the right thing to do. Next few weeks critical in keeping situation under control.
7723,10158300681517900,New Education minister starting the ball rolling

7728,10158300691952900,"No choice, just got to do it. We can’t let the children’s get infected. The children’s are innocent and should not bear the faults for what the country is facing now."
7729,10158300796207900,Parents’ blood pressure goes up from Wednesday onwards.
7730,10158300711262900,Who is this tuition teacher that spread to these children. Is she from INDIA or just returned from INDIA

7732,10158300697162900,Few days ago say school is still consider safe 🤣🤣🤣
7733,10158300901512900,"Anyone smells CB round 2 soon ? Like seriously we had weeks of 0 cases and now bam we are back to square 1.

Why ? Because our government always takes action only when it’s too late"
7734,10158300710297900,"“Thus far, we have no conclusive evidence of school-based transmission”"
7735,10158300872577900,The most right step to take is close the border (airport) & stop in “imports”
7736,10158300698592900,"Ex transport minister say school not the source of the virus, seems like school not so serious, no need to close, now new education boss say close, it must be quite serious.
Must support this new minster."

7785,10158301980172900,Well finally they came to their senses to implement this altho its a bit late... but better late then never. Implementing HBL is better than a full lockdown...
7786,10158300689392900,More students are gonna be infected in the coming weeks. It would be good for some group to adopt HBL until they are eligible for vaccination.

But USA, UK, Singapore, Germany and Australia have all reported large numbers of infected cases with the Indian variant B1617. Inclusive of India, none of the above countries reported children being at higher risks.

Is that Sheep/Cotton minister trying to pull Wool over our eyes this time? 🤦🏻‍♂️

7943,10158300677837900,Malani Selvaraj😟
7944,10158301125052900,Aiyo! Poor thing! I prefer my 3 kids to be in school. Maybe not very convenient if parents hv to WFH and kids hv to do HBL at the same time? And kids have to have their outside time too? Good for their development. Now so restrictive again. I was so happy when I thought that SG is going to open up but now back to square one or even 1 step back from square 1?
7945,10158300680837900,Great. MMTF finally acknowledges that this variant is quite virulent and closing the schools is necessary.
7946,10158300754597900,"Please, people. Can be reasonable??? Do also die, don't do also die.
There are people who want schools to open and some who want schools to close.
Preschool children are young and will require care. Don't just think of yourselves. If their parents are both essential workers and could not afford a helper, then who is going to take care of their kids? Not everyone is so lucky to stay home, ok??? You are encouraged NOT to send your children to preschool, but please leave a road for the ones who need the service!"
7947,10158300738152900,"Is a right step to take. However, we must be mindful of the more venerable children with complicated family where school setting is a better environment for their learning and building of confident and character. Hope social services efforts increase to look out for these."
7948,10158300685097900,"It takes 7 primary schools and 11 students to finally bring schools to a halt and carry on with HBL, which is a far safer option than being on site in school.

Schools are never a safer option compared to homes due to the enlarged and enclosed areas where the students are held. Just look at the canteens, no matter how stringent the covid-19 measures are, especially with the double mutated strains, covid-19 will certainly prevail among our young ones."
7949,10158300716277900,"So.. The signal is very clear already.. After that we will back to last Yr CB.. Because parents will need to take care of the kids..
Let's hope this move will contain the virus and eveyone do our parts to make everyone safe.. 💖✌️"
7950,10158300719912900,"Partial closures, moving to HBL, Work from home and all sorts of requirements do nothing but complicate daily lives and activities. There is a need for us to be proactive rather than being reactive. All these temporary measures might help in the short term but learning from our past migrant worker dormitory outbreak experience, I find there is an urgent need to shutdown completely for 2-3 weeks. We have to do this now before the case numbers spike in hundreds. At that point, HBL, Work from home, MOH coming to pick up suspected cases and sending to hotels for quarantines and such, none of this will remain sustainable or effective. Closures of course will call for government support which seems to be lacking with current measures. All businesses will suffer during this time. I believe people will accept closing down for 2-3 weeks completely and receive some form of government support to tide over this period rather than staying open but with a list of things “not to do” and take another deep financial hit. We can use this 2-3 weeks of closure to create a world record of fastest vaccination drive in a country. Vaccinate every single one. May be.

Ong Ye Kung"
7951,10158301704362900,"Can just cancel all the ongoing/
upcoming mid year exams and have a longer mid year school holiday? The simpler the arrangement is, the better for all. Lesser stress for all - parents, teachers and students."
7952,10158300779887900,"Still remain some rooms for those kids whose parents not able to offer HBL due to working or some special reasons, Schools still need to provide certain supports for the kind of families’ kids. 🙏"
7953,10158300686712900,"Pls let ur children stay home don't make noise because most of us will WFH so don't complain for pre sch still open but if u work from home try to let them at home unless under circumstances..
.please don't be an arrogant ppl"
7954,10158300702477900,"For young kids, personally think, they will be
TOO active at home. Their parents should
let them have a HOBBY, e.g. keeping PETS !!"
7955,10158300683262900,"Good. No romping in malls after school hours will cut down infection possibilities. And with parents working from home, it should remind parents who have forgotten Phase 1 what it was like working from home as well as keep them away from getting infected and spreading the virus during their lunch breaks at work."
7956,10158300735457900,Should close all borders. Putting pre school students and student care kids at more risk in this case.
7957,10158300682427900,"'Announcing this on Sunday, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said authorities understand that the shift to full home-based learning ""may cause anxiety in some parents""

U don't shift to home base then will cause anxiety to parent lo!"

7959,10158300777517900,"Needs time to to make
the procedure,
preparation and detail.
Immediately, not logical.
You give a logical plan,
immediately."
7960,10158300685137900,good to protect the kids from covid
7961,10158300721782900,"Just close the borders!
What’s the point of restricting internally but still letting the imports in."
7962,10158300685572900,"It's now or never. Now that the viruses are spreading in the community, all schools should closed for the time being as our children are not vaccinated and it would be very risky to expose them to the risk out there now. Please stay home stay safe. Now this is not the time to gather and shopping in malls. We wouldn't want to return to Phrase 1 when we completely stop all activities and stay at home. Let us do our part and stop this spread together."
7963,10158300736412900,"Now talk about school .. what’s next... have the government look into day care centre for senior or waiting for another case to Happen? Really no one know.. just My thoughts...vacc
ination is not exlir... vaccines are developed as of earlier situation but now it have become different kind of variant as of now"
7964,10158300778032900,Wait.. affect younger children then y student care n preschool still can operate...? Another half baked policy
7965,10158300736527900,Close Preschools Too!!! They're younger and have poorer immune system
7966,10158300692147900,OMG! Why left the pre-schoolers to go school and the rest all HBL. Gov still think that pre-schoolers need to learn more then the rest?
7967,10158300694717900,"I wish Singapore can close all borders permanently till next year, just like Australia did."
7968,10158300752997900,How abt preschool teachers who have pri sch going kids ?
7969,10158300705747900,What's the logic? So many preschoolers attending extra enrichment too. They are not at risk too? Why they still need to go to school?
7970,10158300695647900,"Personally think The schools should start the SCHOOL
holidays earlier !! To avoid the crowds !!"
7971,10158300723817900,Why wait till Wednesday? You mean they have to choose a special date?
7972,10158300687872900,Its not unexpected and this time round at least CCS is doing it right unlike LW and OYK.
7973,10158300706032900,And whose fault is that again? For bringing in this more virulent strain??
7974,10158300690092900,Piecemeal measures ... still waiting for government to impose ban on receiving passengers from high risk regions.
7975,10158300705172900,"Still don understand why let so many indians come into Singapore when never heard of more Indians leaving sg so need replacement. Economy is slowing down. There aren't increased constructions or sudden extra cleaning work to do done and most dormitory worker from last year should be back to work by now. So why we need to get more fw in? Even maid has to come n go. We need more figures break down of who is coming in or leaving, the detail for more than 10k imported since april, how many are Ep, why they are approved to come in with their dependents and paid so high. Is really a bad impact to sg in the end if sg is locked down. The lost is greater then getting fw to come in since they don't generate income (other then one time quarantine or swap test income). Now making paranoid got to stay at home, avoid school n office, can't go shops or eat out. And this affect working parents a lot. Its super hard to work with kids around. Not declared a Cb so no subsidies to anyone, pte drivers/self employed or low income family who at first got meal help in sch?"
7976,10158300688907900,I just heard now parents are screaming and crying...
7977,10158300706382900,"How about staff working in preschools/
childcares? Childcare teachers with children in Primary/
Secondary Schools, who are the sole caregivers to these children, are unable to care for them and be at work at the same time. How are the Early Childhood Educators provided with support in this situation?"
7978,10158300713427900,"Yes, good decision, because the kids' Safety is more important than anything else!"
7979,10158300695687900,Power la CCS! I was just discussing this topic with children and the news came in. Thanks for understanding our anxiety as parent.👍👍👍
7980,10158300682032900,Why to start only on Wed?! It should be implemented immediately!! It’s not logical
7981,10158300738502900,Actually why don't just bring forward the school holidays like last year?
7982,10158300686777900,Good move. We cannot let undesired things get us down. We can achieve!
7983,10158300780202900,Every hour got changes... think we r so free ah need update ... minister so free is it... look like out of control
7984,10158300693567900,At least now reasonable reasoning come from him rather then cotton come from sheep.
7985,10158300691217900,"Children are the future pillars of our nation – It’s our responsibility to protect them , wise decision 👍"
7986,10158300690047900,"Still want poly students to go back for practicals and lab work, simply asking for trouble. Want to HBL then apply to everyone. Virus perhaps excused those going to polys."
7987,10158300678627900,This is the right thing to do. Next few weeks critical in keeping situation under control.
7988,10158300681517900,New Education minister starting the ball rolling
7989,10158300700332900,But still passengers from india keep coming in at changi airport..

7991,10158300679297900,"The pattern is familiar…
Next step after this is full CB alr."
7992,10158300685292900,Thanks governement for creating all these mess
7993,10158300691952900,"No choice, just got to do it. We can’t let the children’s get infected. The children’s are innocent and should not bear the faults for what the country is facing now."
7994,10158300796207900,Parents’ blood pressure goes up from Wednesday onwards.
7995,10158300711262900,Who is this tuition teacher that spread to these children. Is she from INDIA or just returned from INDIA
7996,10158300699152900,Is tuition ctr close? They should right
7997,10158300697162900,Few days ago say school is still consider safe 🤣🤣🤣
7998,10158300901512900,"Anyone smells CB round 2 soon ? Like seriously we had weeks of 0 cases and now bam we are back to square 1.

Why ? Because our government always takes action only when it’s too late"
7999,10158300710297900,"“Thus far, we have no conclusive evidence of school-based transmission”"
8000,10158300872577900,The most right step to take is close the border (airport) & stop in “imports”
8001,10158300698592900,"Ex transport minister say school not the source of the virus, seems like school not so serious, no need to close, now new education boss say close, it must be quite serious.
Must support this new minster."
8002,10158300749517900,I am kinda worried for preschoolers as well ):
8003,10158300944752900,"How about those poor need to work daily income for food? Money won’t fly down from sky ,Stay home die go work maybe not die ~"
8004,10158300710047900,Time to charge up those ipads parents! Just joking.

8021,10158300994682900,How about those ITE and Poly students?
8022,10158300696962900,"This is why we can’t have nice things. Must meet one last time in groups of 8 last week, must dine out one last time this week 🤦🏻‍♂️"
8023,10158300704232900,y tuition centre got more infection?

8032,10158306640547900,Whos gonna take full responsiblilty if ITE students becum infected 1 by 1?
8033,10158300748557900,"Jobless one how? Those with schooling kids are below 40 years old. All have Job. Talk easy. You no problem and ignore others not the same as you.

8035,10158300703377900,Good... With this decided move on to decide on vaccination roadmap...
8036,10158300899762900,"But after that, they goes to the library. Hence, whats the difference???"
8037,10158300708387900,"Already late, better than never though"
8038,10158301028537900,That is excellent for all students !
8039,10158301003982900,"It is never too late to realise they should have done better. Children are absolutely vulnerable partly due to their age. At any point of time, we have to keep them as top priority in decisions making"
8040,10158300692337900,Pre school still open... 🤷‍♀️

8047,10158300934102900,Hahaha...well expected that these measures are coming up again...
8048,10158301033272900,Longer closure is better.
8049,10158300871862900,"At this rate, by next wk CB. School, then essential shops, business."
8050,10158301980172900,Well finally they came to their senses to implement this altho its a bit late... but better late then never. Implementing HBL is better than a full lockdown...
8051,10158300689392900,More students are gonna be infected in the coming weeks. It would be good for some group to adopt HBL until they are eligible for vaccination.
8052,10158300733517900,Task force should have him. He is clear cut. Thankful he is Minister of Education now. Not LW.
8053,10158301494127900,Good.At least the buses and trains are more quiet without those kids on board.
8054,10158300715752900,"Great but don’t understand why not stop tmw , have to wait till 19."

But USA, UK, Singapore, Germany and Australia have all reported large numbers of infected cases with the Indian variant B1617. Inclusive of India, none of the above countries reported children being at higher risks.

If they stopped them 3 weeks earlier, we will not have this problem. And the government is still letting in infectious people!!! Who’s to blame for this debacle??"

8208,10158300677837900,Malani Selvaraj😟
8209,10157904580327100,"More on the Covid-19 restrictions in Singapore: https://str.sg/
JvgU"
8210,10157904618397100,"I believe school examinations are over. Normally there is not much teaching at the tail end of the term. So, it is all right to conduct home based lessons. Pupils with not much home support will not suffer in the acquisition of knowledge. Better to be safe in this period when community spread of the virus is active."
8211,10157904672827100,Finally they did the right thing. CCS n OYK! Good start! to protect the health welfare of our future generation. Thank you for understanding our community fear and concerns for our children. Thank you! 感恩！👍🏻✊🏻✌🏻❤️🦁🇸🇬🙏🏻
8212,10157904607167100,"Good decision. With the experience from last year and the end of the current school term, HBL will be a good experience for many parents esp the primary 1 students."
8213,10157904592382100,"Good decision. Well done MOE.

My concern are the childcare centres - no priority was given to vaccinate the Teachers and staff there. Now we need them to help parents who are needed at work during the HBL. Should have protected them first with vaccination. ."
8214,10157904591647100,Great ! Can also please someone in charge to review on maids day off for now ?
8215,10157904620127100,"Poor CCS, two days into his term and he's had to make the easiest, I mean the hardest decision of his career."
8216,10157904622012100,"Too bad old LEE is not here, he would nv allow this to happen. Definitely more decisive in closing the borders, then this bunch of 4G clowns. Wait for 4 more years bah."
8217,10157908474602100,"Better to close all the pre schools too..don't wait til have cases

If parents are in essential services, get letter from employer those can go. But those can stay home. Should stay home"
8218,10157904597667100,Sure some parents pulling their hair as some cant take leave especially working essential and have young kids fir hbl... be safe stay safe.
8219,10157904725497100,"Better to be safe than sorry. But again, hope parents can juggle between work and the kids’ studies... 😔
Be safe everyone! This is really worrying ..."
8220,10157904610922100,"Want to put student on HBL, think about the parent also. Working parent how to support kid on HBL? Cannot be leaving the kid alone at home for HBL also right? Government I know you wanted to make safety measures but also think about how this will affect the family members also.."
8221,10157904706777100,"School HBL complain cos parents need to work , cannot dine out complain cos affecting the livelihood of the shop owners, close border complain cos thats where the new variant came from, we need foreign labour complain cos these workers loves to inter mingle , increase capacity of workplace complain, work from home as default complain, phase 2 heightened complain as the gov is trying to avoid CB..2 weeks later if CB sure a pool of idiots will also complain why the government not giving enough financial assistance!

Ok la, smart enough to lead the country in the mist of pandemic? By all means!

Our community will never change creating a forever unhappy bunch of Singaporean.

Probably a time to reflect on one self!
May all of us be protected from this virus. Do take care of your health. Sighh😪"
8222,10157904915322100,We sacrifice our entire population health and safety in order to help the small number of immigrants family to fly in and out of highest risk countries based on compassionate ground. Was it wise ? Will people said we are kind or stupid?
8223,10157904658372100,What is the preventive measures for the ns men in the camp environment? Groups gathering will pose higher risk of virus transmission. Wouldn’t it be better to implement HBL / home based training for the time being?
8224,10157906311112100,"A child life is much more important than studying. When U see your loves one get sick and not able to visit them , by seeing them suffering in the ward then u will regret. Nothing is worth studying at that time."
8225,10157904592857100,Blunder caused to the nation by a few supposed to be a smart individuals! Very very frustrated!
8226,10157904641092100,"A standard squad are made up of more than 30 trainees... how do u ensure SMM in a squad, their breaks for breakfast, lunch and dinner at mass?
When they book out, travelling on public transport, how can the potential of transmission be eliminated?"
8227,10157904584732100,What about preschools ?
8228,10157904599222100,Our 1st class govt will insist they are right in opening borders until only dust and ashes are left.
8229,10157904675502100,"CCS is making all the right political n popular moves, announcing this himself and not through the MTF.

MOM will announce on its own about fdw below 45yo registering for jabs and not MTF.

So, do we still need MTF since the individual ministries are trying to outshine??"
8230,10157904593747100,Finally.. but if can start tmr even better.. but guess better than nothing
8231,10157904594347100,As soon as possible.why drag to 19 may.
8232,10157904590882100,anything but banning flights fr high risk countries 🙄
8233,10157904599332100,Great move from the team finally! 👏 Hope everyone stay safe and the world can heal faster.
8234,10157904741492100,Some school are still having exams. Please quicky allow people under 45 to get vaccinated.
8235,10157904597892100,"I wish Singapore can close all borders permanently till next year, just like Australia did."
8236,10157904590157100,"Why all the new measures come in bit and pieces.?
Very disruptive"
8237,10157904651762100,If we stop sending our kids to sch and preschool. Fee deduction must also halt to be fair
8238,10157904610067100,"“Stressful on students, teachers and parents” - On the hindsight, didn’t the Government and its experts anticipated all these when they insisted on opening the borders to high infectious countries?"
8239,10157904673947100,"Not all parents are wfh.. with older students on hbl, younger kids from child care encouraged to stay home.. who would look after the kids? Why not just have a complete CB like last year? And not like a half CB that is neither here nor there.. this way, non essential companies who are not implementing wfh yet would have no choice to comply.. so parents and kids can all be safe at home.. CB maybe painful for the economy but its effective.. which gives better chance to see the end of the tunnel.."
8240,10157906991777100,"Tbh I really think ITE and Polytechnic should be fully HBL too, there so much student in a Class so personally I felt that it's like a risk for us to go to class just for lessons"
8241,10157904591457100,"And the youngest kids can return to school. Especially when they don’t follow social distancing, don’t wear masks, ignore instructions full on."
8242,10157904644497100,"Thanks le gov, citizens here adhering to regulations to keep everyone safe and life was returning to a sense of normalcy, then you import virus and screw us all over again 😂"
8243,10157904597777100,Don’t understand why can’t just start HBL for all tmr. Why expose our students for 2more days!
8244,10157904594582100,This is the penalty we pay for allowing too many people from a certain South Asia country to come into our country and the community & the local economy are paying the price!😱🤦‍♂️😭
8245,10157904649422100,Lucky preschools still open...as a ftwm and in retail line really hard to take long leave unless urgent matter...
8246,10157904606177100,Preschool remains open....how about preschool teachers with primary school children? Why never think for this group of parents?
8247,10157904723717100,Its not all schools ah polytechnics still have ongoing
8248,10157904590957100,"Still want poly students to go back for practicals and lab work, simply asking for trouble. Want to HBL then apply to everyone. Virus perhaps excused those going to polys, does not infect poly students."
8249,10157904620972100,Just bring forward the 2nd term holiday by 2 weeks and start the 3rd term earlier by 2 weeks very difficult meh....
8250,10157904686567100,Is this only for local schools? Or all including international schools?
8251,10157904584497100,slow slow slow.... better than nothing. Children are more vulernable
8252,10157904583072100,"Finally! Rather late, but better late than never 👌"
8253,10157904585482100,Poly? Internship still on? They are exposed to risks too.
8254,10157904588287100,Y not tomorrow start?? Wait till 19may??
8255,10157904601297100,"Over confidence and wrong decisions over and over again. Just pause the imports. Why let the students suffer. Tuition Teachers, maids and the whole population under 45 are still not vaccinated. What use of keeping students at home right before the exam period when plane loads of virus are still brought in daily. This will create lasting legacy."
8256,10157904627412100,Everyday different surprises n changes! BP n heart beats faster! Can survive COVID19 but not heart attacks!
8257,10157904594887100,I saw parents are screaming and crying...
8258,10157904587017100,Why not monday?
8259,10157904594942100,What about ns men in camps ?
8260,10157904590397100,Kindergartens are still open
8261,10157906078117100,How does home base learning work? Do you have a teacher that needs to go before a camera and teach students that are seeing him or her online?
8262,10157904750057100,But retail shop not close
8263,10157904693497100,How about the rest of international school?
8264,10157904604457100,More case will spike once go into hlb
8265,10157904771397100,Look like lots of things going to start from 19 may 2021. HOW about Airport ????
8266,10157904659932100,Pre school open..means pre school teachers not human ahh..hiazz
8267,10157904595527100,How abt the ITE Students and Poly Student??? Forget is it?
8268,10157904603932100,We're in this together. Rather than half F not here not there. Let's just shut down for 2 weeks and root out the sources of the virus and get back to Phase III at least.. cmon cmon
8269,10157904881687100,But not for kindergarten or childcare’s 😞
8270,10157904771012100,"I guess shld be back to CB 2.0.
since it’s already become bad to worse.
It’s not only SG, more country are also being affected. Not sure when this can ends."
8271,10157904960552100,"Pls advise, if school were to reopen again after end June, what is the arrangement for learning support students or students who are pulled out of their usual class to go for smaller group teachings example English, math and Chinese LSP students. Would these small group classes be able to continue as this would then expose the virus to the entire level. If 1 student from a class is confirmed, and this student who is in that same class and also in the same lsp group, who then be identified as close contact and all the other students in the same LSP class belongs to 8 different classes. This would then mean, all 8 classes have to be identified as a close contact and be quarantined?"
8272,10157904696712100,"Good wake up call for the Govt, they ask people to go back office when they can work from home, now this happens."
8273,10157904998792100,How about day care ?
8274,10157904751967100,Why not implement it immediately instead of later?
8275,10157904627777100,"Coming some(?): hair salons n other non-essential services

Best wishes for us all. Stay healthy n stay at home as far possible"

8287,10157904929972100,Strong bonding for 2 mths
8288,10157904679102100,Next should be closure of malls
8289,10157904600922100,Good Decision...HBL better than closing school as it keep the students at home👍👍👍👍
8290,10157904621937100,Finally public transport won’t be so crowded
8291,10157904651442100,Good move! Fast and Straight Cut Appreciate CCS fast response. Hope he become the next PM

8294,10157904638652100,My next concerns is the enlisted NS-men
8295,10157904605457100,Best decision for current situation.
8296,10157904875712100,"School mid year examinations are over, it is fine for parents and childrens conduct home based. If schools remain open will cause masses of people gathering parents at the gates. Thankful to let children’s stay home, stay safe in this period when community cases spread of the virus."
8297,10157904601442100,"Finally, but not clear again.."
8298,10157904594127100,Where are the resources given to help our pre school children catch up with their learning? ECDA should step up with a compile a guide for them to hand over to our kids parents to coach our kids
8299,10157904599567100,Enhance here and there but did not ehance the main sources and area. Is the ultimate reason it transpired into this situation. We all have to be very becareful as it may become worse than circuit breaker. Thats the reality we have to face. Hope for the best.
8300,10157904670697100,Jus move forward school holidays to 1 wk
8301,10157904713237100,Do you thing 17 & 18 no covid 😒😒😒

8310,10157904593002100,Too little too late innit.
8311,10157904706782100,Such move should have happened earlier. A small step out of so many that needs to be.. theoretically and logically.
8312,10157904831342100,International school also ???
8313,10157904619767100,Till now they dont know how these kids got the virus with masks on

8316,10157904790387100,"I sometimes feel our government ministry love to wait and see the situation than actually JUST DO IT! Waiting for people to dies, numbers of injury person increased or we to feedback loudly enough. Currently is the numbers of infected person. (All based on events and things happen in Singapore)

Than to our surprise they do half hearted job, a half measure. Or suddenly changed their policy again. Due to that unfortunately we still suffer one way or another.

Everyone please seek a doctor when you are feeling unwell. Beware of Convid-19 symptom."

8328,10157904605102100,That’s why you are not a good leader ! Brain dead! Not flexible at all! What’s the priority now? Isn’t it the safety of the children? Or whatever school term etc!!!??? I voted wisely and till today NO REGRET!

If flights in is the cause for the spike, how come previously no issue ? And what about Taiwan ? They closed borders but still have a spike ?

What is more important is, if not feeling well, go see doctor and self quarantine and not run around. Practice safe habits and take necessary precautions lah....maybe u forgotten the mad rush and queues that happened recently for Don Don Donki and IKEA ? So u need the government to step in when common sense should have prevailed ?

Well, there is over confidence in the government part... Over confidence that we would have common sense...."

8465,10158304656502900,"Honestly, preschools should be closed as well. Childcare and studentcare to be open for parents who can’t wfh.
These young ones are told that they can’t sing songs and play together with others... have you interacted with kids below 6yo? 🤦🏻‍♀️

Most childcare centres are pretty small. When they eat or during routine time, their masks are off and they’d definitely talk to each other.

Many preschoolers have older siblings in primary or secondary school.
I’m very worried that there’d be an outbreak in preschools coz can u imagine what these kiddos will be going through?

Please don’t wait until the bomb go jibaboom le then react. Like what these politicians have been doing. The older kids are suffering because of these politicians man 😢"
8466,10158304806757900,"This dribs-and-drabs
strategy is so confusing that even SPH Money FM gave the wrong covid-19 restrictions earlier this afternoon. Someone must explain to the higher-ups aka Ministers the meaning of death by a thousand cuts."
8467,10158304706362900,All adults courses that are conducted in groups should be suspended as well. Stay safe
8468,10158305563272900,Perhaps extra tuition can be phased out permanently as well and people can actually live now.... I think only SG puts so much emphasis on tuition...
8469,10158305311122900,"Please make it mandatory for lifelong learning institutes to convert all classes to online classes too.. Apparently classes are still being conducted physically with multiple learners still coming in and out of the centres to attend their lessons in groups of more than 2 pax. Though this round of viruses may be more prone towards children, that does not mean it does not affect the adults too. We should minimise all these risks now to prevent further clusters from happening. Singapore Ministry of Manpower Ministry of Health, Singapore"
8470,10158304653407900,Remember some time back we wanted to find ways to not have parents not push kids to tuition and lessen pressures on our kids. Turns out the solution was a pandemic.

8474,10158306385772900,I would say piano one on ones especially for the super young kids shd still remain open physically esp this age group like 4 to 7 is too young to do zooming.

They are not on the ground. They are not hawkers, cleaners or office workers etc. we are all trying sooooo hard. But we don’t have ministers payroll. Till date don’t see much ministers voluntarily helping financially? Maybe I’m wrong. But shouldn’t the sacrifice start from the TOP!
Just saying. No offense to anyone"
8501,10158367153142900,"This is quite worrying coz by right, with the many social restrictions during P2HA, community infection should have come down drastically by now (assuming a 21-day incubation period), but it doesn't appear to be so. Hopefully, this trend can be reversed with whatever strategy the govt comes up with next."

8507,10158367224422900,"The fact that COVID-19 is not spreading so rapidly in the migrant dormitories unlike the local communities, shows the lack of social discipline within our society.

8510,10158367223152900,"Numerous feedbacks seen in this thread, covid will be here to stay. Opening up to 2 diners seems reasonable for ppl who work and etc. Opening up slightly also meant that more companies can function maybe better and will aid better business exchanges which equate to increase P & L. Government might be bringing home the dough the same consistently but private sectors and business owners are suffering… if this keeps ups…. What will happen, there should be an inbetween arrangements to aid non- government sectors if not how long can the rest of us last…job security and bring food to the table is a considerable question…."
8511,10158367184447900,"What the COVID-19 task force should evaluate is their target of zero COVID-19 cases or zero deaths?

It's virtually impossible to get zero cases, but as long as we keep the numbers in hospital and ICU to a minimum, then we will minimise deaths.

It's time to start to treat this as an endemic. Gentle reminder even for endemic diseases such as flu and dengue, we still accept cases here and there with occasional deaths.

Keep extending Phase Two at the expense of economy recovery, mental fatigue and growing resentment.

When people are hungry and have no money, I don't think we really care if we kena COVID-19 anymore, since most cases are asymptomatic and we most likely won't die anyway."

Whatever phase we go into, we still need to continue to pay rents, bills etc… all those definitely doesn’t hide behind closed doors right? Let’s be fair and realistic."

8520,10158367158207900,"More clusters from Hawker and market centre. This is worrying.
Deployed Distancing ambassadors and ensure all queuing for takeaway at stalls follow the protocol. If possible set up temperature taking facilities at market and hawker centres too.
We cannot let our guard down else dine in will definetly be delayed next week"
8521,10158367164317900,Allow dining in but limit the group size to 2 or 5 for the survival of the local F&B and also for our sanity. Keep wfh and hbl the default. You can let in south Asians since you seem not to be able to do without them and so that SQ has some jobs to do.

8526,10158367153672900,I hope u will put on hold with regards to the Dine in 21/6 carefully. Is not the best time to open up dining outside yet.
8527,10158367199217900,"Better wait for majority of the population to be vaccinated before allowing dining in /reopening.

With the new clusters, it’s worrying.

We have come this far.
Short term suffering is better when we look at the long term benefits."

and also other misc retails alot."
8529,10158367243137900,"Hope that now atleast snobbish S’poreans understand that the inefficiency is their own and their governments. After all the insecure hullaboo they created on India Indians and possibly all other countries in the world and after they closed themselves for 2 months they are hopelessly unable to control the outbreak in a country of two (or three) streets.

All the countries are now ticked off from the list to blame. Only one left is Burkina Faso I guess 😂"
8530,10158367152802900,Some people don't wear masks properly. Such as cover the mouth only. I also dislike wearing mask. Unable to breathe but I still cooperate. There is recent lady dare to argue with bus captain and refuse to cooperate to wear mask in public transport.
8531,10158367166807900,"Maybe start the dine-in with 2, then open up progressively, rather than completely shutoff."
8532,10158367163677900,Extension after extension. When are you going to start practicing your endemic pitch? What if cases never fall to single digits even after multiple extensions? Deal with it now and stop dragging your feet and hoping for a zero-single digit achievement. This is as much as we can do now.
8533,10158367159477900,Then fence up only that district or estate which seem infected. Why lock the whole nation??
8534,10158367151452900,"Sir , my saving is dried up . No income , bank call up , levy not paid . How ?"
8535,10158367169692900,At least allow 2 pax to dine out as some people got no place to eat.
8536,10158367178442900,Maybe can consider just limit to 2 person dining per table with more crowd control at those eating places like coffee shops and hawker centers. It kinda sadden to see homeless people eating at some isolated corner.
8537,10158367190307900,This will just go on and on...push back opening for F&B dine in will put alot of bizness at stake..At what numbers you think is under control? Cases factuate..So?
8538,10158367166637900,"Please let us dine in, let's try 1 or 2 person first and F&B will still have some income, total ban for dine in is very much inconvenient for people need to run here and there for work or doing errands, furthermore you can't ban forever."
8539,10158367163097900,Closed better. Open also no diner what the point. Closed at least save the plate collecting cost and washing
8540,10158367178602900,"James Ang
We all have to be be realistic. There cannot be zero case everyday..there
be good days and bad days. The virus is gonna stay forever. It's gonna be endemic. So I how to keep going for lock down. We will then have to live on fresh air, bread and water in the long run."

The virus is here to stay for eternity, we cannot possibly make our lives miserable as a result."
8550,10158367726902900,"There is no perfect solution. I think what we need is some certainty. So if the requirement is x percent of population need to be vaccinated before any meaningful reopen can happen.. then let it be so. Draw a line in a sand and stick to it. That is life.. it is imperfect. That is my opinion.. appreciate what has been done so far, understand it is a huge challenge. 🙏"

reopening...just
let it go!"

Health and well-being are much more important than the economy."
8555,10158367223297900,Should be more cautious to do the reopen. Still lots of people who haven’t been vaccinated.
8556,10158367679822900,"It has already been known that this covid is not gonna end up totally and it will continue to stay on. The question is how long can we prolonged the various restrictions given the fact that this pandemic flu is not gonna have a full stop any sooner ?

I have 5 staffs working in my Bangkok food house and all of them were infected to covid 2 months ago. They were being sent by the ambulance to the nearby 3 different hospital for 14 days quarantine ( 2+2+1) and luckily there were all okay and was out from the hospital on the 15th day after the swab result came out negative. When I asked them what kind of treatment was given during their 14 days stay in hospital, they told me they were given paracetamol and oxygen to breath on the first few days until the fever drop down then they stop taking paracetamol. Eventually they were just stay put in their bed for the rest of the quarantine period. During the hospitalisation
period, they were also allowed to order food from grab or consume the food and drinks sent by their relatives/ friends to the hospital.

When I asked them how they felt during the hospitalisation
period, amazingly they told me this is just a normal flu but takes alittle more time to heal compared to the normal fever or flu like symptoms they have previously before this covid thing came out on 2019.
They are now strong as before and continue working as normally.

The doctors has also given them a piece of good advice : to ensure good personal hygiene is the key to prevent from getting flu like infection."
8557,10158367222152900,"Who wants to continue to work from home? The condition will be no dining out

After all I will still meet my colleagues in office and I will also likely do lunch together with my colleagues and probably they may bring along their friends for lunch too"
8558,10158367666772900,"Maybe not a good idea to bring students back in school….most adults are working from home, why the students cannot do HBL???"
8559,10158367300092900,"Since the past week, the situation did not improve... prevailing number of detected unlinked cases has shown that the spread has been continuous within the community... this means that there are presence of undetected cases that remains within the community. The uncovering of the present cluster at bukit merah view hawker centre is just a sight that other such clusters may highly be possible to be present anywhere within singapore and that has yet to be uncovered. We can see that P2(HA) may not be sufficient to suppress the spread practically... more enforcement is required on the ground as pandemic fatigue within the community may become more prevalent, whilst complacency should not be allowed to set in... More extended mass controlled mandate monitored surveillance testing is required in order to pick up such undetected cases while vaccination is conducted. Areas like transportation,
immigration, F&B, public health industry and even vaccinating staff personnel should be tested routinely and regularly, while other suspected cases and close contact remains definite testing requirement, and mandate survaillance testing within the community needs to be extended wider and performed routinely... we got to be reminded that constant high infection rate will only accelerate mutation anywhere within the world..."
8560,10158367487782900,"This government is just taking the easy way out. Lots of major economies are starting to open up. We have less than 20 community cases a day, thats way less than other countries. They are always talk about not closing our border and managing cases if things happen. This is hardly effective managing at all. This is them giving up, passing the consequences to small business and the people. Taskforce isstill stuck in the 2020 covid management mindset, even though majority of the vulnerable population has been vaccinated. If they don't wake up their idea, eventually the people be fed up."
8561,10158367674832900,"Im giving up. Its alrdy known that covid 19 will be around with us for years n so on. By restricting here n there not only we, citizens r getting affected. Those who are working in these areas r also affected. Why dont u just open up. Since we are not able to go into a full lockdown due to watever reasons was said earlier. Then dont waste our time to restrict here n there. Those areas where first vaccinated n there goes cases up from this areas.🙄🙄IM SO DONE WITH ALL THIS."
8562,10158368265102900,"This semi lockdown is akin to when there's a car chain accident at expressway, govt decides to ask all drivers stop using that route for awhile, or worse, stop driving for time being.

Our borders remain open all this while due to Govt's 'Risk-based approach', justifying the need for essential services etc. Granted.

So then, don't keep 'locking down' the whole FnB industry, thinking it will nip the bud. If so, we should have closed all our hospitals and airport previously due to the earlier breakouts there.

Rather, implement stricter enforcements on our social discipline and take firm actions against those who go against it.

Also, If it's deemed 'very safe' to be in crowded public transport, then perhaps crowds in malls should be so too?"

I get the rationale that we need to stop the spread of the virus as quickly as possible, so don't get me wrong. BUT, these lockdowns are wearing thin at this point. If people are using ""trace together"" correctly, in any given scenario within minutes it should be possible to know who has been in contact with who, for how long, when & where and issue quarantine or SH notices to those groups rather than shutting down the entire island. According to MOH statistics approximately 34% of the population are fully vaccinated with an additional approximate 47% having received 1 dose (which is already 65%-85% effective according to some news reports) which means at least 82% of citizens are already have some protection.

Take it as a new normal … while u remain open …
U tested + ve ..u go quarantine

Allow in only those without old or new viruses in land Sea and Air. Special flight .Isolated entry point .Stay in min staffs and workers with full gear for those who will be in contacts with those import viruses
Pre and post virus test .SHN depend those counties local cases .zero or one cases are consider low risk.
These are our view only."
8587,10158367233887900,"The extend of infections can be very great at that hawker center.

With the hugh carpark there, alot of taxi & PHV drivers like to go there for their lunch breaks. With less commuters during HA, these drivers will definable take a longer break thus having higher risk of infection."
8588,10158367279807900,"I hope those angry people reacting to this news are actually those affected by this measures like business owners as this time is a difficult time. For those who yearn to dine out with your friends and due to this measure that doesn't allow you to, I suggest you take a step back and let the authorities do the job. Live with it or die living, your choice."
8589,10158367215377900,"No problem with postponing the next phase, but perhaps allow 1 or 2 pax dine in so that those working outside can at least have a place to eat and also more income for the f&b and drivers etc."
8590,10158367282112900,A lot of people are affected badly if we continue closing down

No dine in. Just do take away & cook at home.

Health & safety come first."

2. Closed space
3. Close Contact"

No where to be seen and bring back our sentiments for parliament to listen and help us! seems we are all out alone and helpless! 😡😡😡"

8598,10158367421777900,Another area of concern is actually the HDB void deck near hawker centres and coffee shops. There you see many uncles and aunties sometime five or more gathering around drinking and talking without mask on. To them the measures like mask and social distancing all thrown out of the window.
8599,10158367626057900,Maybe the phase 2 HA measures not robust enough should consider a full lockdown like other countries

8619,10158367169637900,"Silver lining here is that the one week gap never made sense to begin with. It is too little time to know whether there'd be any spread from stage 1 reopening.

If anything happens in this week, we'll see in the last week of June, 1-2 weeks after everyone started dining out/hanging out in groups of 8. Then rabak liao."

Everything seems to be ok since last July till April this year where there were sudden spike of virus cases. I don't know how they handled the imported n local transmission cases.

8680,10158367205697900,"Didnt they say that way fwd is to focus not on numbers but clinical state of those infected, are they on oxygen support or asymptomatic?
- As Covid-19 becomes endemic around the world, the focus in Singapore will shift away from how many cases there are each day, and more to the clinical condition of these cases.
Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Thursday (June 10) said in such a scenario, ""it's no longer about going after each and every infected case"".
He explained that even if a person were to be infected despite being vaccinated, the infection will likely be very mild or even asymptomatic.

""So we will need a different protocol for such cases,"" said Mr Wong at a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, which he co-chairs.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, his fellow co-chair, said such a shift is already happening, with the authorities looking at the clinical condition of people who are infected here.
This means, for instance, examining how many people need oxygen due to the severity of their condition, and how many are in the intensive care unit.

The ministers were responding to a question about Singapore's Covid-19 strategy in the long-term, when the virus is endemic - meaning it has settled in a certain population in a geographical region, and continues to persist. Some examples of endemic diseases here include influenza, dengue, and hand, foot and mouth disease."

8685,10158367480677900,If TF continues to allow in foreign import then shd allow dine in . All tables must fix a plastic divider to minimise transmission. Ministers lockdown is nothing bcuz they dun eat out anyway but restof citizens r having problems.

8694,10158367224592900,Thanks to the Taskforce and I would suggest to reconsider to reopening of schools after the June holidays. We should not put our kids on stake as we see the cases are not as controlled as we thought. Slow and steady let’s win the game.

8696,10158367257457900,"Stay on current tighten measures! We can't afford kept open and close, open and close. Either u open freely like as normal covid - free or closed/tighten to control covid situation. Businesses, f&b etc invested money and can't kept follow the rules open and close/tighten. This mth allow Dine in then 2 mths later no dine-in. U gov need to set as a big boss father-like example, ur decision made which many people are looking up to.

If they keep extending Phase 2 in 2 week blocks, everytime time the extension happens it's easy to say, it's only two weeks only, can survive one. But when add together, two weeks blocks will become one, two, or even three months block if this persists. I think by then will lose count how many would have to declare bankrupt by then already."

8720,10158367256662900,"The clinical conditions of the new cases must be serious and that is why MMTF is so worried.

Cos the MMTF says that their focus now is on the clinical conditions of the positive cases and not on the daily numbers.

Just my inference."

8727,10158367272292900,"Does not make sense to clamp up on the entire fnb base on community cases. Eateries have closed since a month ago and community cases still happening. What does that mean? it is not the location but the control of asymptomatic cases. It has been unfair to point infection numbers at shopping malls, supermarkets, fnb outlets just because it is mandatory for them to have the grey tracetogether scanner installed. Many private clinics dont even have the grey TT scanner and reception clerks just ""let go"" if difficult patients refuse to scan tt code. Long bus and mrt rides can also be point of spread, but the problem is neglected. I dont think your underlings have been giving you the reports necessary for useful evaluation. Separately, get the data from MOM - how many aunties and uncles above age 50 are working in FnB? Once they are retrenched, they will highly not able to get back the same job even when economy reopens. Companies would rather employ young jobless ones first. The impact of restrictions on FnB extends much further beyond hawkers closing down.
Many suppliers to fastfood chains have also shrunk in size massively and move out of Raffles Place, cutting manpower in accounting, marketing, sales etc. What are the chances of companies employing back 100 staff if they realize they could make do with 20 staff during the pandemic and continue to squeeze these 20 staff thereafter ?? Bigger countries can clamp up whenever they want to, because their lands are big enough for people to dig sweet potatoes in front of their house. I open my door only got concrete floor, how to dig? Make vaccination mandatory for all, no choosing of vaxx, and have those who cannot take the vax do regular weekly swab. Open economy with closed borders, and have every incoming travellers vaccinated (including malaysia delivery drivers) if they havent already done so in their country. BTW, pandemic is no excuse for lacking in job creation."

8798,10158367357167900,Can tell it will be delay to no dine in. In fact the cluster is large enough to go back to Phase 1! No cinema and no entertainment. Essential and retail only. You play with the virus. It stalks you and comes home with you. Stop pretending there is a quick fix to the problem.

U should have gone for a CB instead of leaving the virus going around… how can we pay our employees and rental ? It’s not fair for us and restrictions should have been more strict from the beginning"

8805,10158367169632900,"So what is the end point? Hoping to achieve zero cases is neither practical nor possible. Moving forward, the focus should be on how many hospitalised and ICU cases there are. If these are low, there should be resumption of dining-in with 2 per table."
8806,10158367278442900,"Life needs to go on. Infections may go up but if serious complications are managed or prevented, then we need to live with it. After all, we average 500-600 deaths from flu alone every year."
8807,10158367219477900,"I think there’s a vulnerability in the strategy that needs to be look into urgently.
Public toilets could be a source of transmission and there are repeated instance that our cleaners are always the ones that gets infected first in major clusters.
We have to care for them and ensure that they are well protected. It’s an occupational hazard now.
They need to be provided with face shield and proper masks. They also need to be reminded that mask must be changed after every round of cleaning.
PPE could be provided too but to some, this might seems like it’s overly cautious. When water are sprayed for cleaning, tiny droplets are formed and this might be a problem.
The whole public toilet cleaning, table cleaning, dish washing, stall cleaning, SOPs needs further examination and enhancements.
Please also do not pin the blame on cleaners, hawkers too and the point is, they need to be protected. I think a whole set of safety measures could also prevent more clusters from forming.
We have the most infectious strain of the virus here and current measures must be upgraded to cope and deal with it effectively.
If current measures are not enhanced, I fear for our hawkers. They are really badly hit."
8808,10158367335582900,"How about win-win? Open up dining out to 2? At least restaurants can start their business...so sad to see our F&B suffering.

8810,10158367522237900,"As long as our borders remain opened to imports, the infection rate will not cease. Our containment process is NOT effective.

8817,10158367974732900,"The only way to re-open the country faster is to vaccinate at least 70 to 80 percent of the population. Allow instant online booking appointment with more options of vaccination sites including drive thru vaccination centres. This will definitely help to achieve the targeted higher percentage of vaccinated population and the country will re-open faster. Don’t wait for zero cases as it will not happen even 100% of the population got vaccinated. Covid virus is a family of flu virus and will always mutate from time to time. As long as you’re vaccinated then you’re low risk of dying. Mankind must learn how to live with this virus and continue our life. If wait for zero cases then wait long long, singapore maybe will re-open by 2050."
8818,10158367470162900,"This is going to be a on going nob. Just open up dine in for 2 to 5. We can't just keep closing. Many businesses is suffering.

I was just told that I am unable to pay for the outstanding balance for my BTO via PayNow or eNets at HDB. Why does HDB BTO sales not allow internet banking payments for BTO flats?

They tell me that the ONLY mode of payment is via Cashier’s Order.

They are mandating that I queue at the bank, for who knows how long, to buy a cashier’s order during this precarious Covid-19 pandemic.

Is HDB too irresponsible? I have their correspondence as proof.

Why can’t HDB BTO Sales allow us to pay via internet banking like PayNow since their website states that this service is available for other services?

Would it not be safer than insisting I queue at the bank to purchase a cashier’s order.

Why is HDB so uncaring? Do they not understand the severity of this pandemic? With their reckless attitude, is it any wonder why we are seeing more community cases?

Is HDB undermining the government’s efforts to control Covid-19? Do we need another Circuit Breaker for them to take this seriously?

Mr. Wong, I plead with you to please look into this matter urgently to better control the spread of Covid-19.

I thank you in anticipation of a favourable response."
8822,10158367370242900,at least allow single dinning per table. otherwise people just pack and look for a bench somewhere to eat same what
8823,10158368650227900,"What was the point of disallowing dining in at eateries but allowing eating at common spaces?

Dining at eateries seems more controlled and hygienic then eating at common spaces (eg. Void decks, parks, benches just outside the hawker centre and anywhere else other than the eateries), at least there are cleaners and regulations in place. Although there are also regulations in the common spaces supposed to be enforced by the Town Council, but things like people leaving their leftovers and trash all over still happens very frequently.

Personally, if you want to disallow eating at eateries, then include common spaces as well.

8898,10158367233812900,Do you know if you register for vaccination now you are given a slot end July. Definitely Singapore is not in a hurry to vaccinate the population.
8899,10158367228507900,"You cannot keep locking down the whole economy, people are losing jobs and businesses just because of a few IRRESPONSIBLE people!! Please be wise. We are SICK and tired of these nonsense, life needs to go on. Lockdown is worse than getting covid as we are already vaccinated! At least 50% are already vaccinated once. Use your brain la. You cannot let those who can't wait to die (refuse to vaccinate, refuse to wear masks) kill the economy right?!!"

8925,10158367164542900,"Now that the COVID-19 test kits are sold in the open market for $10 to $13, the government can encourage people to buy and do self testing by offering free swabbing service at all clinics and reimburse the clinics for the swabbing services. The consumer pays only for the kits.

Assuming the pharmacy has a 50% profit margin on selling the test kits, then the clinics can offer the test kits with free swabbing services.

I believe there is a market for swabbing services but the consumer pays for the test kits.

In short, all pharmacies selling the kit at $12 earns a $6 profit. But the clinics can offer the testing services and earn the $6 instead. Otherwise levy a service charge for swabbing."

8943,10158367816002900,"the task force has utterly no idea of whats going on nor do they know in which direction this pandemic is going to , everything sits on a very thin layer with the task force only demands take your vaccinations and be safe ,likewisea all these clusters are abviosuly still surfacing among vaccinated people and yet the MOH has not revealed any data to the public and besides some organisations are demanding that only vaccinated people are allowed for religious and other activities ,there shld never be a discrimination towards social norms ,hence a fine line should be addressed ."
8944,10158367383657900,Alamak! Have to move backward again!
8945,10158367308122900,This goes to show that some of the measures taken are ineffective and theory is very different from practice.
8946,10158367219767900,"No risk no gain, opening up n let everyone be responsible to prevent the spread domestically. Gov just needs to keep a tight watch for different strands slipping in through international gateways."
8947,10158367150432900,Still can open for dine in afrer 21sr June. LOL
8948,10158367330372900,"Till date. Yes we need to take care of one another. Try to survive together. It’s not easy. But while the ministers doing their judgement etc
They are not on the ground. They are not hawkers, cleaners or office workers etc. we are all trying sooooo hard. But we don’t have ministers payroll. Till date don’t see much ministers voluntarily helping financially? Maybe I’m wrong. But shouldn’t the sacrifice start from the TOP!
Just saying. No offense to anyone"
8949,10158367153142900,"This is quite worrying coz by right, with the many social restrictions during P2HA, community infection should have come down drastically by now (assuming a 21-day incubation period), but it doesn't appear to be so. Hopefully, this trend can be reversed with whatever strategy the govt comes up with next."
8950,10158367169327900,"More people die from smoking, cancer, road accidents in the last 3 months of 2020 then Covid. We learn to live with all those, what makes Covid so special? It's overplayed! Ministers don't lose their jobs or get pay cut. Think of the majority of the people where putting food on the table is a major concern."
8951,10158367161442900,"If Bukit Merah cluster is worrying, how about the decision to open school for the students after June school holidays?"
8952,10158367160402900,Please open up the dine-in with max 2 pax for a start rather than forbid it completely.
8953,10158367149287900,Many developed countries are already opening up and moving on but here we are. If I were an expat I’d go home if I’m working from home anyway
8954,10158367178342900,Let works together and make it together as one. Need not using naughty remarks. Frankly. We have done well as a nation compared to the world. Thanks guys cool down and works toward the right objective. Let make thus epidemic over soonest possible.
8955,10158367224422900,"The fact that COVID-19 is not spreading so rapidly in the migrant dormitories unlike the local communities, shows the lack of social discipline within our society.

Everyone has to be socially discipline and to observe all the COVID-19 preventive measures. Period.

Otherwise, the relevant authorities should take firm actions against people who flout the measures in order for COVID-19 to be contained."
8956,10158367190962900,"Do wat also wrong I guess.. Lockdown got lockdown problem.. reopen got reopen problem.. I’m sure no matter wat happen, ppl will have lots to say.. ya so.. it’s never gg to please everyone one… with this covid situation, many ppl have gone crazy.. maybe they just rather get covid then go crazy?"
8957,10158367222147900,Must be appreciative and grateful. We must have trust with the ministers and the ministries. They always have the best solution for the people. The best of the best.
8958,10158367223152900,"Numerous feedbacks seen in this thread, covid will be here to stay. Opening up to 2 diners seems reasonable for ppl who work and etc. Opening up slightly also meant that more companies can function maybe better and will aid better business exchanges which equate to increase P & L. Government might be bringing home the dough the same consistently but private sectors and business owners are suffering… if this keeps ups…. What will happen, there should be an inbetween arrangements to aid non- government sectors if not how long can the rest of us last…job security and bring food to the table is a considerable question…."
8959,10158367184447900,"What the COVID-19 task force should evaluate is their target of zero COVID-19 cases or zero deaths?

It's virtually impossible to get zero cases, but as long as we keep the numbers in hospital and ICU to a minimum, then we will minimise deaths.

It's time to start to treat this as an endemic. Gentle reminder even for endemic diseases such as flu and dengue, we still accept cases here and there with occasional deaths.

Keep extending Phase Two at the expense of economy recovery, mental fatigue and growing resentment.

When people are hungry and have no money, I don't think we really care if we kena COVID-19 anymore, since most cases are asymptomatic and we most likely won't die anyway."
8960,10158367192137900,"It is becoming a joke parade already - but we all have to live in it. So I re-phrase: it is a nightmare! Pls open up, vaccinate faster and live together with covid and continue our life. 🤪🤯🤷🏽‍♀️"
8961,10158367207912900,"Since Spore likes to import foreign talents, why not we also import taskforce from countries such as China, New Zealand, HK, Israel etc..to help us solve our problems, since they can control their Covid infected figures so low for such a long period.
Somemore is much cheaper than our current local taskforce which cost taxpayers 4 to 20 times more $$."
8962,10158367207567900,Mask up in public.. Exercising or other. We still have peopke strolling n chatting w mask off. We people running n chatting online with mask off. We have people still wearing mask just to protect the chin.... We are just a very crowded space that maintaining distancing can be difficult...
8963,10158367153687900,"Please lock down until end of the world laa. No need dine in, no need anything. We willingly just stay alive or died just at home!"
8964,10158367151147900,"Open dinning pls T.T
Maybe limit the number of ppl per table.. not everybody can packet home to eat :("
8965,10158367213797900,"Looks like Covid is here to stay…hiding behind closed doors is no use. Businesses need to carry on and so does our lives. Learn to live with Covid since everyone is being socially responsible. We need to work and keep our jobs to feed our families. I can understand its a pandemic but it’s beginning to sound kinda selfish already. Whatever phase we go into, we still need to continue to pay rents, bills etc… all those definitely doesn’t hide behind closed doors right? Let’s be fair and realistic."
8966,10158367185387900,"It’s the new norm by the Govt eventually…rele
ase and tighten the phase until at least 80% of population are vaccinated"
8967,10158367179112900,Government no clue what to do. Just justify continue extend. Don't expect them to make any decisions. Will just take easy path and be very safe. What else to expect from this team.
8968,10158367158207900,"More clusters from Hawker and market centre. This is worrying.
Deployed Distancing ambassadors and ensure all queuing for takeaway at stalls follow the protocol. If possible set up temperature taking facilities at market and hawker centres too.
We cannot let our guard down else dine in will definetly be delayed next week"
8969,10158367164317900,Allow dining in but limit the group size to 2 or 5 for the survival of the local F&B and also for our sanity. Keep wfh and hbl the default. You can let in south Asians since you seem not to be able to do without them and so that SQ has some jobs to do.
8970,10158367155112900,"Close further and anyone from the task force wants to perish with the businesses? First world country, last world management."
8971,10158367186497900,Distancing ambassadors should check out the cycling routes and beaches. Big groups cycling together in the early morning.
8972,10158367152467900,"So what does this mean? No dine in on 21 June.
If so, pls inform earlier as restaurant and other F&B needs to prepare their ingredient n food in advance."
8973,10158367186047900,"If you want lock, please fully lock la. Fnb and retail businesses suffering so much now because of this. Sales drop more than 60%. Your Gss support is so little and the payout is a few months later. Use some brain please"
8974,10158367153672900,I hope u will put on hold with regards to the Dine in 21/6 carefully. Is not the best time to open up dining outside yet.
8975,10158367199217900,"Better wait for majority of the population to be vaccinated before allowing dining in /reopening.

With the new clusters, it’s worrying.

We have come this far.
Short term suffering is better when we look at the long term benefits."
8976,10158367154742900,"Hope to start off with progressive dining in for 2 with stricter distancing. It will help the F&B, hawkers,cabbies
and also other misc retails alot."
8977,10158367243137900,"Hope that now atleast snobbish S’poreans understand that the inefficiency is their own and their governments. After all the insecure hullaboo they created on India Indians and possibly all other countries in the world and after they closed themselves for 2 months they are hopelessly unable to control the outbreak in a country of two (or three) streets.

All the countries are now ticked off from the list to blame. Only one left is Burkina Faso I guess 😂"
8978,10158367152802900,Some people don't wear masks properly. Such as cover the mouth only. I also dislike wearing mask. Unable to breathe but I still cooperate. There is recent lady dare to argue with bus captain and refuse to cooperate to wear mask in public transport.
8979,10158367166807900,"Maybe start the dine-in with 2, then open up progressively, rather than completely shutoff."
8980,10158367163677900,Extension after extension. When are you going to start practicing your endemic pitch? What if cases never fall to single digits even after multiple extensions? Deal with it now and stop dragging your feet and hoping for a zero-single digit achievement. This is as much as we can do now.
8981,10158367159477900,Then fence up only that district or estate which seem infected. Why lock the whole nation??
8982,10158367151452900,"Sir , my saving is dried up . No income , bank call up , levy not paid . How ?"
8983,10158367169692900,At least allow 2 pax to dine out as some people got no place to eat.
8984,10158367178442900,Maybe can consider just limit to 2 person dining per table with more crowd control at those eating places like coffee shops and hawker centers. It kinda sadden to see homeless people eating at some isolated corner.
8985,10158367190307900,This will just go on and on...push back opening for F&B dine in will put alot of bizness at stake..At what numbers you think is under control? Cases factuate..So?
8986,10158367166637900,"Please let us dine in, let's try 1 or 2 person first and F&B will still have some income, total ban for dine in is very much inconvenient for people need to run here and there for work or doing errands, furthermore you can't ban forever."
8987,10158367163097900,Closed better. Open also no diner what the point. Closed at least save the plate collecting cost and washing
8988,10158367178602900,"James Ang
We all have to be be realistic. There cannot be zero case everyday..there
be good days and bad days. The virus is gonna stay forever. It's gonna be endemic. So I how to keep going for lock down. We will then have to live on fresh air, bread and water in the long run."

9004,10158367679822900,"It has already been known that this covid is not gonna end up totally and it will continue to stay on. The question is how long can we prolonged the various restrictions given the fact that this pandemic flu is not gonna have a full stop any sooner ?

I have 5 staffs working in my Bangkok food house and all of them were infected to covid 2 months ago. They were being sent by the ambulance to the nearby 3 different hospital for 14 days quarantine ( 2+2+1) and luckily there were all okay and was out from the hospital on the 15th day after the swab result came out negative. When I asked them what kind of treatment was given during their 14 days stay in hospital, they told me they were given paracetamol and oxygen to breath on the first few days until the fever drop down then they stop taking paracetamol. Eventually they were just stay put in their bed for the rest of the quarantine period. During the hospitalisation
period, they were also allowed to order food from grab or consume the food and drinks sent by their relatives/ friends to the hospital.

When I asked them how they felt during the hospitalisation
period, amazingly they told me this is just a normal flu but takes alittle more time to heal compared to the normal fever or flu like symptoms they have previously before this covid thing came out on 2019.
They are now strong as before and continue working as normally.

The doctors has also given them a piece of good advice : to ensure good personal hygiene is the key to prevent from getting flu like infection."

The uncovering of the present cluster at bukit merah view hawker centre is just a sight that other such clusters may highly be possible to be present anywhere within singapore and that has yet to be uncovered. We can see that P2(HA) may not be sufficient to suppress the spread practically... more enforcement is required on the ground as pandemic fatigue within the community may become more prevalent, whilst complacency should not be allowed to set in... More extended mass controlled mandate monitored surveillance testing is required in order to pick up such undetected cases while vaccination is conducted. Areas like transportation,
immigration, F&B, public health industry and even vaccinating staff personnel should be tested routinely and regularly, while other suspected cases and close contact remains definite testing requirement, and mandate survaillance testing within the community needs to be extended wider and performed routinely... we got to be reminded that constant high infection rate will only accelerate mutation anywhere within the world..."

Our borders remain open all this while due to Govt's 'Risk-based approach', justifying the need for essential services etc. Granted.

So then, don't keep 'locking down' the whole FnB industry, thinking it will nip the bud. If so, we should have closed all our hospitals and airport previously due to the earlier breakouts there.

Rather, implement stricter enforcements on our social discipline and take firm actions against those who go against it.

If people are using ""trace together"" correctly, in any given scenario within minutes it should be possible to know who has been in contact with who, for how long, when & where and issue quarantine or SH notices to those groups rather than shutting down the entire island. According to MOH statistics approximately 34% of the population are fully vaccinated with an additional approximate 47% having received 1 dose (which is already 65%-85% effective according to some news reports) which means at least 82% of citizens are already have some protection.

Take it as a new normal … while u remain open …
U tested + ve ..u go quarantine
U tested + ve and unwell … u seek treatment so that affected do not need ventilator or icu ….that’s the main Focus ….

How to balance social distancing while eating.
2 person at a table .The table is at least one meter apart. Min number of customers in the stores or shops.
Allow to use outdoor for dinning.eg roads. walkway ..carparks etc.
Since there are 3 unlink cases daily.
Min circuit breaker to achieve zero or one local cases.
How ?? The task force Have to think about it.
Allow in only those without old or new viruses in land Sea and Air. Special flight .Isolated entry point .Stay in min staffs and workers with full gear for those who will be in contacts with those import viruses
Pre and post virus test .SHN depend those counties local cases .zero or one cases are consider low risk.

9128,10158367205697900,"Didnt they say that way fwd is to focus not on numbers but clinical state of those infected, are they on oxygen support or asymptomatic?
- As Covid-19 becomes endemic around the world, the focus in Singapore will shift away from how many cases there are each day, and more to the clinical condition of these cases.
Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Thursday (June 10) said in such a scenario, ""it's no longer about going after each and every infected case"".
He explained that even if a person were to be infected despite being vaccinated, the infection will likely be very mild or even asymptomatic.

""So we will need a different protocol for such cases,"" said Mr Wong at a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, which he co-chairs.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, his fellow co-chair, said such a shift is already happening, with the authorities looking at the clinical condition of people who are infected here.
This means, for instance, examining how many people need oxygen due to the severity of their condition, and how many are in the intensive care unit.

The ministers were responding to a question about Singapore's Covid-19 strategy in the long-term, when the virus is endemic - meaning it has settled in a certain population in a geographical region, and continues to persist. Some examples of endemic diseases here include influenza, dengue, and hand, foot and mouth disease."

9142,10158367224592900,Thanks to the Taskforce and I would suggest to reconsider to reopening of schools after the June holidays. We should not put our kids on stake as we see the cases are not as controlled as we thought. Slow and steady let’s win the game.
9143,10158367293757900,Tis time round tis better late than early
9144,10158367257457900,"Stay on current tighten measures! We can't afford kept open and close, open and close. Either u open freely like as normal covid - free or closed/tighten to control covid situation. Businesses, f&b etc invested money and can't kept follow the rules open and close/tighten. This mth allow Dine in then 2 mths later no dine-in. U gov need to set as a big boss father-like example, ur decision made which many people are looking up to. Economy will not so soon recover back so dont be indecisive."

never be rid of it anyway🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄"
9147,10158367191917900,"Will an extended Phase 2 be accompanied by more relief for those affected, like those in the F&B sector?

If they keep extending Phase 2 in 2 week blocks, everytime time the extension happens it's easy to say, it's only two weeks only, can survive one. But when add together, two weeks blocks will become one, two, or even three months block if this persists. I think by then will lose count how many would have to declare bankrupt by then already."

9151,10158367153867900,Siao Liao lor. They should just limited gatherings at 2 paxs and dining in at 2 paxs. Increasing the no of paxs will increase the capacity that ppl go out to eat n mingle more.

9157,10158367485392900,"I really struggle to understand the government’s objectives and reopening conditions. Are they trying to get to near zero cases, avoid a specific level of hospitalisation
or avoid deaths? There are never any infection models released and a huge lack of transparency on the reopening approach. Covid is not going away and Singapore needs to get clear on what living with Covid looks like. We cannot become a hermit nation!"

9168,10158367256662900,"The clinical conditions of the new cases must be serious and that is why MMTF is so worried.

Cos the MMTF says that their focus now is on the clinical conditions of the positive cases and not on the daily numbers.

Just my inference."

9175,10158367272292900,"Does not make sense to clamp up on the entire fnb base on community cases. Eateries have closed since a month ago and community cases still happening. What does that mean? it is not the location but the control of asymptomatic cases. It has been unfair to point infection numbers at shopping malls, supermarkets, fnb outlets just because it is mandatory for them to have the grey tracetogether scanner installed. Many private clinics dont even have the grey TT scanner and reception clerks just ""let go"" if difficult patients refuse to scan tt code. Long bus and mrt rides can also be point of spread, but the problem is neglected. I dont think your underlings have been giving you the reports necessary for useful evaluation. Separately, get the data from MOM - how many aunties and uncles above age 50 are working in FnB? Once they are retrenched, they will highly not able to get back the same job even when economy reopens. Companies would rather employ young jobless ones first. The impact of restrictions on FnB extends much further beyond hawkers closing down.
Many suppliers to fastfood chains have also shrunk in size massively and move out of Raffles Place, cutting manpower in accounting, marketing, sales etc. What are the chances of companies employing back 100 staff if they realize they could make do with 20 staff during the pandemic and continue to squeeze these 20 staff thereafter ?? Bigger countries can clamp up whenever they want to, because their lands are big enough for people to dig sweet potatoes in front of their house. I open my door only got concrete floor, how to dig? Make vaccination mandatory for all, no choosing of vaxx, and have those who cannot take the vax do regular weekly swab. Open economy with closed borders, and have every incoming travellers vaccinated (including malaysia delivery drivers) if they havent already done so in their country. BTW, pandemic is no excuse for lacking in job creation."

9246,10158367357167900,Can tell it will be delay to no dine in. In fact the cluster is large enough to go back to Phase 1! No cinema and no entertainment. Essential and retail only. You play with the virus. It stalks you and comes home with you. Stop pretending there is a quick fix to the problem.
9247,10158367785407900,"I already say we cannot allow dine in
No dine in Bukit Merah hawker centre already so severe
Guys we need discipline
Pap can’t do it alone"
9248,10158367172017900,"It s not fair for us in FnB, there is no clusters in restaurants and we are controlled every 10 Mns by URA ? Why shall we keep our outlets closed and u keep the malls opened ? Everyday I see group of people pic Nic in parks and street which is supposed to not be legal ? Because of those people we are paying ? U should have gone for a CB instead of leaving the virus going around… how can we pay our employees and rental ? It’s not fair for us and restrictions should have been more strict from the beginning"
9249,10158367151177900,"Lawrence Wong
U and your panel are doing
quite well with the situation
presently. But with the ongoing spread, pls consider seriously to the opening of Dine In on 21st June. For the safety of all Singaporeans, an extension
Is most necessary -an act of
precaution. God Bless 👍🏼"
9250,10158367219067900,I cant believe that whether i get an income is dependent on what you think is safe for us.
9251,10158367163942900,"Maybe we should give up on snuffing the virus out, health might be important but livelihoods lost and lives destroyed due to repeated lockdowns is just an ALTERNATIVE form of DEATH."
9252,10158367159332900,"In this moment, lock down or semi-lock down will not be the best option already.. proceed vaccination rapidly asap after 60% done, we will be relief for ourselves more and can see more options to save the people In SG.."
9253,10158367169632900,"So what is the end point? Hoping to achieve zero cases is neither practical nor possible. Moving forward, the focus should be on how many hospitalised and ICU cases there are. If these are low, there should be resumption of dining-in with 2 per table."
9254,10158367278442900,"Life needs to go on. Infections may go up but if serious complications are managed or prevented, then we need to live with it. After all, we average 500-600 deaths from flu alone every year."
9255,10158367219477900,"I think there’s a vulnerability in the strategy that needs to be look into urgently.
Public toilets could be a source of transmission and there are repeated instance that our cleaners are always the ones that gets infected first in major clusters.
We have to care for them and ensure that they are well protected. It’s an occupational hazard now.
They need to be provided with face shield and proper masks. They also need to be reminded that mask must be changed after every round of cleaning.
PPE could be provided too but to some, this might seems like it’s overly cautious. When water are sprayed for cleaning, tiny droplets are formed and this might be a problem.
The whole public toilet cleaning, table cleaning, dish washing, stall cleaning, SOPs needs further examination and enhancements.
Please also do not pin the blame on cleaners, hawkers too and the point is, they need to be protected. I think a whole set of safety measures could also prevent more clusters from forming.
We have the most infectious strain of the virus here and current measures must be upgraded to cope and deal with it effectively.
If current measures are not enhanced, I fear for our hawkers. They are really badly hit."
9256,10158367335582900,"How about win-win? Open up dining out to 2? At least restaurants can start their business...so sad to see our F&B suffering.
And be extra vigilant in getting the ambassadors to implement the 2 dining out!
Let's get F&B out too!"
9257,10158367224492900,If authorities are complacent and dont heed advice then whatever we do isnt effective
9258,10158367522237900,"As long as our borders remain opened to imports, the infection rate will not cease. Our containment process is NOT effective. The virus has already infiltrated into the community. It's far too late to control it. Prevention is better than cure. Unfortunately, our covid19 taskforce has failed miserably to prevent or contain it."
9259,10158367369877900,"Experts! Experts! Many small businesses are dying, workers have zero income and the gahmen is not doing much to help them! All because of your stupid risk-based imports!"
9260,10158367242122900,DO NOT HOLD ON THE DINNING IN PLAN. OPEN UP !! OPEN UP!!!! FOR GOODNESS SAKE!!! IT IS ESSENTIAL THING. THINK OF ALL THE F&B OWNERS. THEY ARE SUFFERING!!!! YOU GUYS CAN HAVE HOME COOKED MEALS IF YOU ARE SCARE TO DIE WHEN DINNING IN OUTSIDE.
9261,10158367208347900,"Well you get what you sow. Keep insisting to import from high risk countries when told not to. As usual, sinkies are the ones to suffer from your inept covid committee."
9262,10158367213187900,"So many selfish comments calling for continued lock down.
Please consider the F&B industry and the job affected.
Continued lock down will eventually lock SG economy down"

9265,10158367974732900,"The only way to re-open the country faster is to vaccinate at least 70 to 80 percent of the population. Allow instant online booking appointment with more options of vaccination sites including drive thru vaccination centres. This will definitely help to achieve the targeted higher percentage of vaccinated population and the country will re-open faster. Don’t wait for zero cases as it will not happen even 100% of the population got vaccinated. Covid virus is a family of flu virus and will always mutate from time to time. As long as you’re vaccinated then you’re low risk of dying. Mankind must learn how to live with this virus and continue our life. If wait for zero cases then wait long long, singapore maybe will re-open by 2050."
9266,10158367470162900,"This is going to be a on going nob. Just open up dine in for 2 to 5. We can't just keep closing. Many businesses is suffering.
Is the same like what you Ministers tell us. You say we cannot afford to closed our broder for our economy.
So why you close our shop."
9267,10158367214102900,"Enforcement should be stricter at food centres. A lot of the hawkers don't follow rules, especially the foreign hawkers at Tekka."
9268,10158367152617900,"Outbreaks will happen but if this the kind of world Dear Leader envisions under a new normal then it is worrying because Singaporeans lifestyle will be like a roti prata, always flipping"
9269,10158368534362900,"Is HDB clueless or careless about the Covid-19 pandemic?

I was just told that I am unable to pay for the outstanding balance for my BTO via PayNow or eNets at HDB. Why does HDB BTO sales not allow internet banking payments for BTO flats?

They tell me that the ONLY mode of payment is via Cashier’s Order.

They are mandating that I queue at the bank, for who knows how long, to buy a cashier’s order during this precarious Covid-19 pandemic.

Is HDB too irresponsible? I have their correspondence as proof.

Why can’t HDB BTO Sales allow us to pay via internet banking like PayNow since their website states that this service is available for other services?

Would it not be safer than insisting I queue at the bank to purchase a cashier’s order.

Why is HDB so uncaring? Do they not understand the severity of this pandemic? With their reckless attitude, is it any wonder why we are seeing more community cases?

Is HDB undermining the government’s efforts to control Covid-19? Do we need another Circuit Breaker for them to take this seriously?

Mr. Wong, I plead with you to please look into this matter urgently to better control the spread of Covid-19.

I thank you in anticipation of a favourable response."
9270,10158367370242900,at least allow single dinning per table. otherwise people just pack and look for a bench somewhere to eat same what
9271,10158368650227900,"What was the point of disallowing dining in at eateries but allowing eating at common spaces?

Dining at eateries seems more controlled and hygienic then eating at common spaces (eg. Void decks, parks, benches just outside the hawker centre and anywhere else other than the eateries), at least there are cleaners and regulations in place. Although there are also regulations in the common spaces supposed to be enforced by the Town Council, but things like people leaving their leftovers and trash all over still happens very frequently.

Personally, if you want to disallow eating at eateries, then include common spaces as well.

9346,10158367233812900,Do you know if you register for vaccination now you are given a slot end July. Definitely Singapore is not in a hurry to vaccinate the population.
9347,10158367228507900,"You cannot keep locking down the whole economy, people are losing jobs and businesses just because of a few IRRESPONSIBLE people!! Please be wise. We are SICK and tired of these nonsense, life needs to go on. Lockdown is worse than getting covid as we are already vaccinated! At least 50% are already vaccinated once. Use your brain la. You cannot let those who can't wait to die (refuse to vaccinate, refuse to wear masks) kill the economy right?!!"

9373,10158367164542900,"Now that the COVID-19 test kits are sold in the open market for $10 to $13, the government can encourage people to buy and do self testing by offering free swabbing service at all clinics and reimburse the clinics for the swabbing services. The consumer pays only for the kits.

Assuming the pharmacy has a 50% profit margin on selling the test kits, then the clinics can offer the test kits with free swabbing services.

I believe there is a market for swabbing services but the consumer pays for the test kits.

In short, all pharmacies selling the kit at $12 earns a $6 profit. But the clinics can offer the testing services and earn the $6 instead. Otherwise levy a service charge for swabbing."

They are not on the ground. They are not hawkers, cleaners or office workers etc. we are all trying sooooo hard. But we don’t have ministers payroll. Till date don’t see much ministers voluntarily helping financially? Maybe I’m wrong. But shouldn’t the sacrifice start from the TOP!
Just saying. No offense to anyone"
9397,10158367153142900,"This is quite worrying coz by right, with the many social restrictions during P2HA, community infection should have come down drastically by now (assuming a 21-day incubation period), but it doesn't appear to be so.

Opening up to 2 diners seems reasonable for ppl who work and etc. Opening up slightly also meant that more companies can function maybe better and will aid better business exchanges which equate to increase P & L. Government might be bringing home the dough the same consistently but private sectors and business owners are suffering… if this keeps ups…. What will happen, there should be an inbetween arrangements to aid non- government sectors if not how long can the rest of us last…job security and bring food to the table is a considerable question…."
9407,10158367184447900,"What the COVID-19 task force should evaluate is their target of zero COVID-19 cases or zero deaths?

It's virtually impossible to get zero cases, but as long as we keep the numbers in hospital and ICU to a minimum, then we will minimise deaths.

It's time to start to treat this as an endemic. Gentle reminder even for endemic diseases such as flu and dengue, we still accept cases here and there with occasional deaths.

Keep extending Phase Two at the expense of economy recovery, mental fatigue and growing resentment.

When people are hungry and have no money, I don't think we really care if we kena COVID-19 anymore, since most cases are asymptomatic and we most likely won't die anyway."

Deployed Distancing ambassadors and ensure all queuing for takeaway at stalls follow the protocol. If possible set up temperature taking facilities at market and hawker centres too.
We cannot let our guard down else dine in will definetly be delayed next week"
9417,10158367164317900,Allow dining in but limit the group size to 2 or 5 for the survival of the local F&B and also for our sanity. Keep wfh and hbl the default. You can let in south Asians since you seem not to be able to do without them and so that SQ has some jobs to do.

9428,10158367163677900,Extension after extension. When are you going to start practicing your endemic pitch? What if cases never fall to single digits even after multiple extensions? Deal with it now and stop dragging your feet and hoping for a zero-single digit achievement. This is as much as we can do now.
9429,10158367159477900,Then fence up only that district or estate which seem infected. Why lock the whole nation??

9431,10158367169692900,At least allow 2 pax to dine out as some people got no place to eat.
9432,10158367178442900,Maybe can consider just limit to 2 person dining per table with more crowd control at those eating places like coffee shops and hawker centers. It kinda sadden to see homeless people eating at some isolated corner.
9433,10158367190307900,This will just go on and on...push back opening for F&B dine in will put alot of bizness at stake..At what numbers you think is under control? Cases factuate..So?
9434,10158367166637900,"Please let us dine in, let's try 1 or 2 person first and F&B will still have some income, total ban for dine in is very much inconvenient for people need to run here and there for work or doing errands, furthermore you can't ban forever."
9435,10158367163097900,Closed better. Open also no diner what the point. Closed at least save the plate collecting cost and washing

9452,10158367679822900,"It has already been known that this covid is not gonna end up totally and it will continue to stay on. The question is how long can we prolonged the various restrictions given the fact that this pandemic flu is not gonna have a full stop any sooner ?

I have 5 staffs working in my Bangkok food house and all of them were infected to covid 2 months ago. They were being sent by the ambulance to the nearby 3 different hospital for 14 days quarantine ( 2+2+1) and luckily there were all okay and was out from the hospital on the 15th day after the swab result came out negative. When I asked them what kind of treatment was given during their 14 days stay in hospital, they told me they were given paracetamol and oxygen to breath on the first few days until the fever drop down then they stop taking paracetamol. Eventually they were just stay put in their bed for the rest of the quarantine period. During the hospitalisation
period, they were also allowed to order food from grab or consume the food and drinks sent by their relatives/ friends to the hospital.

When I asked them how they felt during the hospitalisation
period, amazingly they told me this is just a normal flu but takes alittle more time to heal compared to the normal fever or flu like symptoms they have previously before this covid thing came out on 2019.
They are now strong as before and continue working as normally.

The doctors has also given them a piece of good advice : to ensure good personal hygiene is the key to prevent from getting flu like infection."

The uncovering of the present cluster at bukit merah view hawker centre is just a sight that other such clusters may highly be possible to be present anywhere within singapore and that has yet to be uncovered. We can see that P2(HA) may not be sufficient to suppress the spread practically... more enforcement is required on the ground as pandemic fatigue within the community may become more prevalent, whilst complacency should not be allowed to set in... More extended mass controlled mandate monitored surveillance testing is required in order to pick up such undetected cases while vaccination is conducted. Areas like transportation,
immigration, F&B, public health industry and even vaccinating staff personnel should be tested routinely and regularly, while other suspected cases and close contact remains definite testing requirement, and mandate survaillance testing within the community needs to be extended wider and performed routinely... we got to be reminded that constant high infection rate will only accelerate mutation anywhere within the world..."

Those who are working in these areas r also affected. Why dont u just open up. Since we are not able to go into a full lockdown due to watever reasons was said earlier.

Our borders remain open all this while due to Govt's 'Risk-based approach', justifying the need for essential services etc. Granted.

So then, don't keep 'locking down' the whole FnB industry, thinking it will nip the bud. If so, we should have closed all our hospitals and airport previously due to the earlier breakouts there.

Rather, implement stricter enforcements on our social discipline and take firm actions against those who go against it.

If people are using ""trace together"" correctly, in any given scenario within minutes it should be possible to know who has been in contact with who, for how long, when & where and issue quarantine or SH notices to those groups rather than shutting down the entire island. According to MOH statistics approximately 34% of the population are fully vaccinated with an additional approximate 47% having received 1 dose (which is already 65%-85% effective according to some news reports) which means at least 82% of citizens are already have some protection.

Allow to use outdoor for dinning.eg roads. walkway ..carparks etc.
Since there are 3 unlink cases daily.
Min circuit breaker to achieve zero or one local cases.
How ?? The task force Have to think about it.
Allow in only those without old or new viruses in land Sea and Air. Special flight .Isolated entry point .Stay in min staffs and workers with full gear for those who will be in contacts with those import viruses

9576,10158367205697900,"Didnt they say that way fwd is to focus not on numbers but clinical state of those infected, are they on oxygen support or asymptomatic?
- As Covid-19 becomes endemic around the world, the focus in Singapore will shift away from how many cases there are each day, and more to the clinical condition of these cases.
Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Thursday (June 10) said in such a scenario, ""it's no longer about going after each and every infected case"".
He explained that even if a person were to be infected despite being vaccinated, the infection will likely be very mild or even asymptomatic.

""So we will need a different protocol for such cases,"" said Mr Wong at a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, which he co-chairs.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, his fellow co-chair, said such a shift is already happening, with the authorities looking at the clinical condition of people who are infected here.
This means, for instance, examining how many people need oxygen due to the severity of their condition, and how many are in the intensive care unit.

The ministers were responding to a question about Singapore's Covid-19 strategy in the long-term, when the virus is endemic - meaning it has settled in a certain population in a geographical region, and continues to persist. Some examples of endemic diseases here include influenza, dengue, and hand, foot and mouth disease."

9581,10158367480677900,If TF continues to allow in foreign import then shd allow dine in . All tables must fix a plastic divider to minimise transmission. Ministers lockdown is nothing bcuz they dun eat out anyway but restof citizens r having problems.

This mth allow Dine in then 2 mths later no dine-in. U gov need to set as a big boss father-like example, ur decision made which many people are looking up to.

If they keep extending Phase 2 in 2 week blocks, everytime time the extension happens it's easy to say, it's only two weeks only, can survive one. But when add together, two weeks blocks will become one, two, or even three months block if this persists. I think by then will lose count how many would have to declare bankrupt by then already."

9623,10158367272292900,"Does not make sense to clamp up on the entire fnb base on community cases. Eateries have closed since a month ago and community cases still happening. What does that mean? it is not the location but the control of asymptomatic cases. It has been unfair to point infection numbers at shopping malls, supermarkets, fnb outlets just because it is mandatory for them to have the grey tracetogether scanner installed. Many private clinics dont even have the grey TT scanner and reception clerks just ""let go"" if difficult patients refuse to scan tt code. Long bus and mrt rides can also be point of spread, but the problem is neglected. I dont think your underlings have been giving you the reports necessary for useful evaluation. Separately, get the data from MOM - how many aunties and uncles above age 50 are working in FnB? Once they are retrenched, they will highly not able to get back the same job even when economy reopens. Companies would rather employ young jobless ones first. The impact of restrictions on FnB extends much further beyond hawkers closing down.
Many suppliers to fastfood chains have also shrunk in size massively and move out of Raffles Place, cutting manpower in accounting, marketing, sales etc. What are the chances of companies employing back 100 staff if they realize they could make do with 20 staff during the pandemic and continue to squeeze these 20 staff thereafter ?? Bigger countries can clamp up whenever they want to, because their lands are big enough for people to dig sweet potatoes in front of their house. I open my door only got concrete floor, how to dig? Make vaccination mandatory for all, no choosing of vaxx, and have those who cannot take the vax do regular weekly swab. Open economy with closed borders, and have every incoming travellers vaccinated (including malaysia delivery drivers) if they havent already done so in their country. BTW, pandemic is no excuse for lacking in job creation."

9701,10158367169632900,"So what is the end point? Hoping to achieve zero cases is neither practical nor possible. Moving forward, the focus should be on how many hospitalised and ICU cases there are. If these are low, there should be resumption of dining-in with 2 per table."
9702,10158367278442900,"Life needs to go on. Infections may go up but if serious complications are managed or prevented, then we need to live with it. After all, we average 500-600 deaths from flu alone every year."
9703,10158367219477900,"I think there’s a vulnerability in the strategy that needs to be look into urgently.
Public toilets could be a source of transmission and there are repeated instance that our cleaners are always the ones that gets infected first in major clusters.
We have to care for them and ensure that they are well protected. It’s an occupational hazard now.
They need to be provided with face shield and proper masks. They also need to be reminded that mask must be changed after every round of cleaning.
PPE could be provided too but to some, this might seems like it’s overly cautious. When water are sprayed for cleaning, tiny droplets are formed and this might be a problem.
The whole public toilet cleaning, table cleaning, dish washing, stall cleaning, SOPs needs further examination and enhancements.
Please also do not pin the blame on cleaners, hawkers too and the point is, they need to be protected. I think a whole set of safety measures could also prevent more clusters from forming.
We have the most infectious strain of the virus here and current measures must be upgraded to cope and deal with it effectively.
If current measures are not enhanced, I fear for our hawkers. They are really badly hit."
9704,10158367335582900,"How about win-win? Open up dining out to 2? At least restaurants can start their business...so sad to see our F&B suffering.

9713,10158367974732900,"The only way to re-open the country faster is to vaccinate at least 70 to 80 percent of the population. Allow instant online booking appointment with more options of vaccination sites including drive thru vaccination centres. This will definitely help to achieve the targeted higher percentage of vaccinated population and the country will re-open faster. Don’t wait for zero cases as it will not happen even 100% of the population got vaccinated. Covid virus is a family of flu virus and will always mutate from time to time. As long as you’re vaccinated then you’re low risk of dying. Mankind must learn how to live with this virus and continue our life. If wait for zero cases then wait long long, singapore maybe will re-open by 2050."

I was just told that I am unable to pay for the outstanding balance for my BTO via PayNow or eNets at HDB. Why does HDB BTO sales not allow internet banking payments for BTO flats?

They tell me that the ONLY mode of payment is via Cashier’s Order.

They are mandating that I queue at the bank, for who knows how long, to buy a cashier’s order during this precarious Covid-19 pandemic.

Is HDB too irresponsible? I have their correspondence as proof.

Why can’t HDB BTO Sales allow us to pay via internet banking like PayNow since their website states that this service is available for other services?

Would it not be safer than insisting I queue at the bank to purchase a cashier’s order.

Why is HDB so uncaring? Do they not understand the severity of this pandemic? With their reckless attitude, is it any wonder why we are seeing more community cases?

Is HDB undermining the government’s efforts to control Covid-19? Do we need another Circuit Breaker for them to take this seriously?

Mr. Wong, I plead with you to please look into this matter urgently to better control the spread of Covid-19.

I thank you in anticipation of a favourable response."

9719,10158368650227900,"What was the point of disallowing dining in at eateries but allowing eating at common spaces?

Dining at eateries seems more controlled and hygienic then eating at common spaces (eg. Void decks, parks, benches just outside the hawker centre and anywhere else other than the eateries), at least there are cleaners and regulations in place. Although there are also regulations in the common spaces supposed to be enforced by the Town Council, but things like people leaving their leftovers and trash all over still happens very frequently.

Personally, if you want to disallow eating at eateries, then include common spaces as well.

9794,10158367233812900,Do you know if you register for vaccination now you are given a slot end July. Definitely Singapore is not in a hurry to vaccinate the population.
9795,10158367228507900,"You cannot keep locking down the whole economy, people are losing jobs and businesses just because of a few IRRESPONSIBLE people!! Please be wise. We are SICK and tired of these nonsense, life needs to go on. Lockdown is worse than getting covid as we are already vaccinated! At least 50% are already vaccinated once. Use your brain la. You cannot let those who can't wait to die (refuse to vaccinate, refuse to wear masks) kill the economy right?!!"

9821,10158367164542900,"Now that the COVID-19 test kits are sold in the open market for $10 to $13, the government can encourage people to buy and do self testing by offering free swabbing service at all clinics and reimburse the clinics for the swabbing services. The consumer pays only for the kits.

Assuming the pharmacy has a 50% profit margin on selling the test kits, then the clinics can offer the test kits with free swabbing services.

I believe there is a market for swabbing services but the consumer pays for the test kits.

In short, all pharmacies selling the kit at $12 earns a $6 profit. But the clinics can offer the testing services and earn the $6 instead. Otherwise levy a service charge for swabbing."

9839,10158367816002900,"the task force has utterly no idea of whats going on nor do they know in which direction this pandemic is going to , everything sits on a very thin layer with the task force only demands take your vaccinations and be safe ,likewisea all these clusters are abviosuly still surfacing among vaccinated people and yet the MOH has not revealed any data to the public and besides some organisations are demanding that only vaccinated people are allowed for religious and other activities ,there shld never be a discrimination towards social norms ,hence a fine line should be addressed ."
9840,10158367383657900,Alamak! Have to move backward again!
9841,10158367308122900,This goes to show that some of the measures taken are ineffective and theory is very different from practice.
9842,10158367219767900,"No risk no gain, opening up n let everyone be responsible to prevent the spread domestically. Gov just needs to keep a tight watch for different strands slipping in through international gateways."
9843,10158367150432900,Still can open for dine in afrer 21sr June. LOL
9844,10158423321822900,Please lah.. how many times must you flip flop the dine in rules. Who caused all these problems in the first place? You are making the F&B operator's lives very difficult.
9845,10158423486112900,Why discriminate again? Please keep at 2 for dine in only. I will sure not dine in a restaurant if sees there are 5 in one table! What makes the team think that all vaccinated sitting together is safe? No logic! Sg has got Prata experts 🙊
9846,10158423575977900,Why so complicated? Just revert to 2 and when situations improved then increase to 5. Bear with it for awhile!
9847,10158423427687900,This rule sounds like rewarding the rich who can afford to eat in restaurants but depriving the poor from have a meal with their family at a coffee shop or hawker centre
9848,10158423351312900,"Suka suka, apa ini !
You can't even handle the KTV, and you want to open the border !
What ENDEMIC you have been talking ?
The gov don't really know the people well, very sad."
9849,10158423377482900,How about the safety measurement for public transports? It’s always full during peak hours
9850,10158423383932900,I really pity those who is allergic to mRNA but in the end take sinovac. They will be considered as not vaccinated
9851,10158423329147900,"You can’t contain a hostess causing this cluster despite the measures enforced, you won’t be able to do so for tourists daily! Open what border are we gonna be masked w max dine out 2 forever!"

Not only ordinarily people suffered, now even businesses and businessman are also suffering, for sure PAP will FEEL it comes 2025!! 🤨"
9854,10158423327082900,Vaccinated also can get infected right. Then another cluster will form.
9855,10158423340087900,Only thing I can say is be grateful we can still dine in & walkabout. Look North.
9856,10158423328612900,"How about sinovac vaccination? If that is not considered, would we be allowing anyone vaccinated with sinovac into the country? Can the authorities clarify on this?"
9857,10158423338682900,"Should we start a petition to sue those KTVs for the mental distress caused by their troubles, on top of what the gov has clamp on them. We did so hard to maintain good status quo for P2HA, and finally open, for this to happen."
9858,10158423403902900,"Ppl confuse , dine-in back to 2 unless you fully vaccinated can do 5... and what about the busses and train ? Always crowded ?"
9859,10158423424817900,"How i wish everyone in SG cld mark down this date n yearly curse at these KTV owners n the bunch of chikopek customers for causing SG's regression of our covid measure. 3 steps fwd n 2 steps back. Just for business n quickie happy hours for some chikopeks n drag n set the whole SG backward. Inconveniencing
thosands of ppl (to go do testing), hawkers biz closed, afftecting others in the neighbourhood hv to opt to go elsewhere further to get food, having to make arrangements with employers, families etc before doing the test, some causing whole family hv to do the test..... Still, potentially this cld hv spread to other unknown, yet-to-be traceable individuals or grps... n many more other possibilities.
These owners r really pest n selfish.
It shld not b taken lightly or seen as it is just their problem. Now they hv created a problem for the whole of SG.

I also wish they can b grilled like satay.

I hope the law will mete out to these owners a lot more heavier punishment so as to set the bar n deter future similar repeat cases after the measure is eased again at later times.

Just bcos of them, the whole SG u-turn back the covid measures is really uncalled for n Singaporeans don't deserve this.
Wish i cld personally go slap each of these ktv owners (& their biz partners, if any) n wake up their ideas."
9860,10158423402942900,Consequence of KTV fast-tracked to F&B plus questionable S-T pass grants heaps frost upon snow (雪上加霜) to the cruise industry and the legitimate F&B industry. Extremely disappointing 😔
9861,10158423313712900,"Introverts: Maybe I shouldn’t get vaccinated so I’ve excuse not to go out. Extroverts: Lets get vaccinated NOW! Jokes aside, everyone pls get vaccinated."
9862,10158423360702900,how is this not discriminatory ! oh wrong word used. is differentiated.
9863,10158423396307900,Enclosed area. Poor ventilation. Air condition room. Please tell me virus will not transmitted in such environment.
9864,10158423338787900,"Standardised it, vaccinated or not, keep it to two. Why make more work for SDA and F&B staff after knowing it's diners breaking rules and finding loopholes all the time?"
9865,10158423399417900,"Are such KTV outlets checked by safe management ambassador? If yes, how frequent?"

9870,10158424500857900,"When they say unvaccinated does it mean those who are totally not vaccinated yet or those who have received only first dose and yet to receive 2nd dose? I don’t see any terms such as partially vaccinated. There is a gray area here . So let’s say my husband has completed his 2 doses and me only 1, we go out with our child under 1 can we dine out together ? It’s so bloody confusing all these rules !!!"
9871,10158423345637900,All thanks to the KTV chao turtles and butterflies.
9872,10158423321827900,We’re now facing the consequences just because some men were unable to control themselves and engaged in risky social activities in the middle of a pandemic at the expense of others ☹️

9874,10158423374427900,Will MOH disclose how many of the current infected have had 2 vaccinations? Is it really safe to have a group of 5 fully vaccinated dining together?
9875,10158423344417900,So … unvaccinated parents with a small kid can or can’t dine out from Sunday?
9876,10158423348152900,There is a song that doesn't end it goes on and on my friend.. some. people started singing not knowing what it was and we go aroundand go on singing cos it a a song that doesnet end

9881,10158423336627900,"Can i suggest only people in the same family or working in the same office can seat together. Meaning we cannot share table with stranger, whether is 2 or 5 persons per table."

9884,10158423396112900,"I need to bring my Warrant of vaccination letter walk around to show i had done my vaccine before i can have my breakfast, lunch and dinner ?"
9885,10158423317917900,"Fully vaccinated so u treat covid as endemic, not vaccinated treat covid as pandemic. Vaccinated also can be infected, those go KTV vaccinated or not, why they treat covid as endemic ?🤣"
9886,10158423314207900,"We should fixed at a group of five, and work on it. It would be too simple a job if there is a wobbling objective."

“Can u show me your negative result since u r not fully vaccinated?”"

9890,10158423324137900,"pls lah!! just dun open the KTV or other hostessesssssss
sss lounges!! dun penalized us from dining out!! y must KTV be classified under F&B??!!! DUH!! just closed down all these KTV with hostesssssssess
ssss!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
9891,10158423324927900,"Expected already....last
year also same"
9892,10158423317047900,What's the point of these measures? Even you're full vaccinated when close contact will covid positive and when contact trancing MOH will still contact you and escort you to hotel for 14 days staycation.
9893,10158423337357900,"Decent restaurants and bars have conformed to these rules for over a year, at great expense. Then the government allows hundreds of these establishments to open if they serve fries. Everyone knows these places have blacked out windows for a reason. Who the hell made that decision. It’s a disgrace"
9894,10158423322287900,How will they even know if ppl fully vaccinated anyone could say fully vaccinated
9895,10158423362462900,"Back to square one again , just when we decided to dine out after months 😓"
9896,10158423714647900,How to check n know if fully vaccinated? We cannot ask for their vaccination certs. Mat offend customers at coffeeshops.
9897,10158424187747900,Not sure why many are complaining abt dining in when this is only just for a couple of weeks. We've been thru the worse before in 2020. National safety more impt than dining out.
9898,10158424536792900,"Honestly it does not matter if its 2 or 5. What matters is can't talk or intermingle between the 2 or 3 tables. In fact no difference really 2 pax per table cause a family of 4. No mask at home. Walk together but when comes to dining they have to occupied 2 tables. Then after dining walk together as a family and no face mask at home. No logic but its the rules. In fact people will find ways by instead of eating at the food court such as satay by the bay. They pack their food and eat on the grass area in groups of 5. No face mask..

The truth also arranging for tables for 2. Its just feel safer. .less crowd and there proper social distance."
9899,10158423411532900,"But how are u going to control hawker centres, coffedshop, etc still back to 2 safer, if 5 uncles happy go lucky drinking with pretty bird"
9900,10158423384167900,Now from 5 reduced to 2 for dine in❗
9901,10158423658612900,Why making it so complicated? Make as two for now. How sure the 5 in one table are all vaccinated?
9902,10158423494652900,"A waiter told me, daily the table no. keep changing. Everyday table arrangement change"
9903,10158423366867900,So seats still limited for diners.
9904,10158423391142900,How would u know all 5 have been vaccinated u think all got time to check bunch of morron thanks to them
9905,10158423611612900,"The 5 lasted long then!

Because of those who felt it was right and ok to go to ktv

You know who they are.

But just blaming the Vietnamese hostesses.

How funny"
9906,10158423508867900,"screwed up MMTF. Dine in size is the default go-to measure to adjust as soon as there’s a cluster. When actually, f&bs are steadily complying. 2,5,10 don’t really make much of a difference."
9907,10158423323807900,Because next week got public holiday 🤣🤣🤣
9908,10158423571192900,"Make authority mafan only, who want to catch oh.. must be a lot of quarrel after, all got excuse.. straight to the point, limit 2 person enough… wait until this wave pass then resume.. nth to be paiseh to U-turn, life matter.. 🙊"

10030,10158425096572900,"Does it makes a big difference medically on the group size or the rule is just trying to encourage ppl to take the vaccine?

Vaccinated still can catch the virus.
Worst is if they mingle with ppl who yet to or unable to take the vaccine. Than the virus continues spreading as well."

Gov then increase the no. Of dine in...
Sure got another funny cluster come out again..

Please la.. SG GOVERNMENT, EITHER U TOTALLY SET NO DINE- IN ALL THE WAYS UNTIL EVERY SINGAPOREAN FULLY VACCINE THEN U OPEN DINE IN..

Is there any scientific research to state that Vaccinated person will not get infected with Covid and that the vaccine guarantees 100% protection against the virus?

Scientific research has shown that even Vaccinated person can still get infected with Covid.

Do you think that this policy is going to create divide and xenophobic within the community?

Similarly to the policy of MRNA technology Vaccines vs inactivated Virus Technology Vaccines. 🤦‍♂️

If a vaccine is indeed unsafe, do you think the health authority will still allow the jabs at private clinics?

Simply Discriminating…

There are bound to have people within the Community with various reasons for not being vaccinated. Eg: allergy, health reason, etc
Are we going to discriminate these people for being unvaccinated or taking inactivated technology vaccine?

Should just keep it at 2 or 5 regardless vaccinated or unvaccinated."

Study or work too much until dont know how our immune system works?
Millions around the world have already recovered. Why so scared until like that? If you are not vaccinated but have sufficient sleep supported by supplements, your body will produce antibodies to fight wat .. Dont know this simple basic concept meh? Just don’t let it be severe case then long Covid will not happen. (Sufficient sleep will produce sufficient immune cells that will kill Covid n other viruses, bacterias etc upon their entry so that they do not have a chance to multiply and circulate in our bloodstream and reach other organs.)

Follow Switzerland: Mask only in buildings, public transport and enclosed areas. Dining no limit. Basic hygiene: Hand sanitiser at all shops, restaurants etc. They even put small hand sanitisers at dining tables of a snack bar I went to last Sunday.
The idea is to let the citizens lead a new normal life as soon as possible for the mental and physical well-being of all, to prevent family quarrels, kids sibling quarrels, family break-ups when people are stuck at home; businesses going bankrupt, financial problems etc etc.
The costs are outweighing the benefits in SG and must be correct asap!

My 6.5 yr old triplets hvg been asking to go to SG to see their grandparents (my parents). How to go? Quarantine will cost our family of 5 a bomb! Switzerland doesnt even hv any quarantine if you pass the PCR test upon entry! Follow Switzerland leh .. I want to go back to SG to see my parents and simply enjoy SG again. I am sure many Singaporeans overseas hv the same sentiments."

10544,10158023171107100,"Rubbish! Being jabbed with experimental mRNA gene vaccines with multiple side effects and unknown long term data which is also NOT approved to prevent the spread of Covid 19 is NOT a symbol of health. The novel vaccines are only approved for emergency use.

The most susceptible to severe Covid 19 symptoms are the elderly, obese and those with underlying illnesses.

This reeks of a diabolical agenda to discriminate against those who decline the genetic vaccines. How are the ministers and the expert committee going to look in the mirror without flinching after this diabolical move?"

Study or work too much until dont know how our immune system works?
Millions around the world have already recovered. Why so scared until like that? If you are not vaccinated but have sufficient sleep supported by supplements, your body will produce antibodies to fight wat .. Dont know this simple basic concept meh? Just don’t let it be severe case then long Covid will not happen. (Sufficient sleep will produce sufficient immune cells that will kill Covid n other viruses, bacterias etc upon their entry so that they do not have a chance to multiply and circulate in our bloodstream and reach other organs.)

Follow Switzerland: Mask only in buildings, public transport and enclosed areas. Dining no limit. Basic hygiene: Hand sanitiser at all shops, restaurants etc. They even put small hand sanitisers at dining tables of a snack bar I went to last Sunday.
The idea is to let the citizens lead a new normal life as soon as possible for the mental and physical well-being of all, to prevent family quarrels, kids sibling quarrels, family break-ups when people are stuck at home; businesses going bankrupt, financial problems etc etc.
The costs are outweighing the benefits in SG and must be correct asap!

My 6.5 yr old triplets hvg been asking to go to SG to see their grandparents (my parents). How to go? Quarantine will cost our family of 5 a bomb! Switzerland doesnt even hv any quarantine if you pass the PCR test upon entry! Follow Switzerland leh .. I want to go back to SG to see my parents and simply enjoy SG again. I am sure many Singaporeans overseas hv the same sentiments."

Guess the government needs to assess its risks a little bit better eh!"
10851,10158030906257100,"Please

1. Revoke licenses for those pivoted KTVs. Don’t expect these nightlifes to turn into decent F&Bs overnight.

2. Harsher punishment for the offenders (eg Mandatory jail term), operators and patrons included. Fines are too affordable for them.

3. Disallow STVPs. We are fighting a battle here, we don’t need hostesses here.

No sympathy for the KTVs and no more merry go round please."

For those who refuse vaccination, should consider again for the larger good of everyone.

As for the govt, hope they continue to tighten borders for visitors from high risk countries, stop KTV business conversion, impose stricter safe distancing, better controls of all ports of entry including wholesale centres, fishery ports and take serious actions against shady ktv operators and illegal hostesses."

We just gotta live with Covid-19 like an endemic cases like dengue. As long as imports are coming, there will always be Covid cases. All these “No Dine-in stunts” are already causing many F&B business to go bankrupt and causing a lot of mental stresses & turmoils for the people. I’m not surprise if crime will be on the rise.
At least allow 1-2 people to dine-in. Amidst living in this stressful & uncertainty pandemic times, sometimes just able to dine-out alone to relax & calm down, can actually be de-stressing & do many wonders for the mind.

There will always be a ripple effect 🤬"
10860,10158030666022100,Pls move schools to HBL. There are students who have not completed their vaccination regime and those under 12 are not eligible. Let's bite the bullet and close schools since we are only weeks away to reaching herd immunity. We cannot afford large scale outbreaks in our schools.

And if sending your kids to sch is a major concern for u, what is stopping u from taking them out of sch for the rest of the week and see how things play out? (Unless your issue is u cannot stand your kids missing a few days if other kids aren’t?)"
10862,10158030827212100,Many seniors don't care because they don't have a job to lose since they are not working. A cleaner at a food court even said that he wish for dining in to be banned longer so he need not clean tables. What he said made sense because who will want to work if you get the same salary whether you work or not!
10863,10158030699002100,These hum sap lo men and businesses who supply such services should kneel on durian shells and apologise to the country... The men more so... since there's supply only because there's demand... 🤬
10864,10158030797392100,Companies or essential businesses that require their employees to work in the office premises should order lunch and dinner sets so as to minimize their staff heading out to hawker centers and food courts.

Close open close. Where it all ends? There will be no end to this even if the entire population is vaccinated.
10866,10158030664522100,Well so much for the mountain of graphics that was churned the past few days and confused so many!

Then just come out n tell ppl stay home …

10870,10158030697347100,"Karma hits back.

Super rubbish experts who allowed indoor activities like KTV with F&B.

Now everyone suffers because of multi millionaire salaries staffs and experts.

Have they given $$$ to F&B and work fare for companies for daily losses for last 3-4 months, no right.

Disgusting ripple effect."
10871,10158030671992100,You put your dining in. You put your dining out. You put your dining in and your shake it all about

removing those stickers or plastics on tables, isnt it NOT environment friendly ? especially for those environment friendly people. ALSO even if ONE FAMILY, when dine out why must sit together? FOCUS on eating. EAT and GO!"
10883,10158030675687100,"Vaccinated adults - WFH
Non-vaccinated children - mingle in school"
10884,10158030807682100,"We understand the concern of the seniors who do not wish to vaccinate. Of about 100,000+. What are the chances of them changing their mind. In fact MTF hve done so much for them..no booking.. near them even knocking at their door. So shd more than half the population of SG hve to wait for them to get vaccinated. In fact these group shd have no financial probems ie taken CPF or hve children support. No worry on money. On the other hand we also hve to think of those who need to work to support their family... children.. even their parents. No work no pay. As what always mentioned. Life must go on. The world need to spin. So let it be. We cannot wait forever. They shd know the consequences.
Dining in should be allowed for those already vaccinated as what earlier mentioned.
Maybe new rule - Above 70 yrs not vaccinated cannot enter.(unless valid reasons)"
10885,10158030655582100,Singapore always alert and well done 👍
10886,10158030687507100,What is the use of all these when companies in SG still wanted their employees to go back to office although they can wfh. How many cases have went up due to their short sighted? SG government sld punish the employers more severely instead of just fine them. Making all decision makers to the jail terms is more beneficial to all workers!
10887,10158030667932100,"Those hanky panky ktv closed permanently! 😤😤😤
It's really unfair to those decent f&b and hawkers!"
10888,10158030679287100,"Why does it open, close and open again? Can we close the border and monitor closely till there are zero cases for at least 14 days before we open border again. We know economy will be impacted but the impact will not be that great just to have it safe for all Singaporean."

Now what we are looking for is the day where we can just have a meal together with the whole family of 8 or 10. Seems to hve to wait... Age 70 n above..how many 10 years u still hve. Treasure each day. If eveyone get vaccinated the day will come faster."
10908,10158030841802100,"Seems like this government doesn't really have a plan. It's reactive rather than pro-active (in the case of dealing with the ktv ""bistros""). I feel really bad for our Muslim community and also the F&B establishments.

10909,10158031080527100,Thanks to the irresponsible selfish KTV gang! They should be severely punished for causing this and making everyone suffer! 💔 Take care & stay safe everyone. Let's hope that things will get better soon 🙏🏿😔

10987,10158031423322100,"More than a hundred years ago, Rudolf Steiner wrote the following:

” In the future, we will eliminate the soul with medicine. Under the pretext of a ‘healthy point of view’, there will be a vaccine by which the human body will be treated as soon as possible directly at birth, so that the human being cannot develop the thought of the existence of soul and Spirit.
To materialistic doctors, will be entrusted with the task of removing the soul of humanity. As today, people are vaccine against this disease or disease, so in the future, children will be vaccinated with a substance that can be produced precisely in such a way that people, thanks to this vaccination, will be immune to being subjected to the “madness” of spiritual life. He would be extremely smart, but he would not develop a conscience, and that is the true goal of some materialistic circles.
With such a vaccine, you can easily make the etheric body loose in the physical body. Once the etheric body is detached, the relationship between the universe and the etheric body would become extremely unstable, and man would become an automaton, for the physical body of man must be polished on this Earth by spiritual will. So, the vaccine becomes a kind of arymanique force; man can no longer get rid of a given materialistic feeling. He becomes materialistic of constitution and can no longer rise to the spiritual “.

唯物主義的醫生，將被賦予消滅人

接種疫苗後，身體的以太體會變得
鬆弛。

一旦以太體脫離肉身，宇宙與以太

由於人的肉體是必須在地球上通過
精神意志的鍛鍊，而疫苗將人變得

""....antibodies
can aggravate rather than mitigate disease. This occurs because certain cells of the immune system take up antibody-tagged
microbes and destroy them. If a virus particle to which antibodies have bound is taken up by such a cell, but it then manages to evade destruction, it may instead start to multiply within the cell. Overall, the antibody will then have enhanced the replication of the virus. Clinically, this antibody-depend
ent enhancement (ADE) can cause a hyperinflammato
ry response (a “cytokine storm”) that will amplify the damage to the lungs, liver and other organs of our body."" ....D4CE

So which is riskier ....catching covid naturally or getting vaccinated ?

And which group causes more problems (eg vaccine induced/
enhanced infections, vaccine breakthrough infections, vaccine enhanced transmissions, vaccine prolonged disease, vaccine induced/
enhanced mutations etc) for all ....the vaccinated or the unvaccinated ?

So who's misleading whom and are people being told the truth? That is the question ....

Where the benefits of covid vaccinations are still questionable and where there are severe risks including death from these unapproved highly questionable vaccines, there must be individual choice and it is wrong, unethical and unconstitutiona
l to make vaccinations mandatory or to impose various discriminatory restrictions to force people to vaccinate etc ....

To each their own informed choice please ...."

Enforce vaccinations if necessary or make it conditional that unless all personnel are fully vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna in any commercial sector, there will be a complete cease. Each time the measures are relaxed there is a false sense of security and complacency and this happens. How long is this going to go on and when will we learn that unless we put our foot down and say nothing is going to be permitted until 75% to 80% of the populace are vaccinated. No compromise. Then only will we see containment. A syring decisive resolve instead of doing the cha cha with measures. If we do not act decisively once and for all, Malaysia is going to contain the virus quicker than we do. Bear in mind viruses are opportunistic and they do not recognise the word economy."

OYK's ambition - still got plenty of ICU beds and ventilators unused; worry only when the beds and ventilators are all used up? What's wrong with you?

The amount of stress families go thru is extreme if someone is infected. It’s better to prevent now then allow all hell break loose then take action later. Cases can soar to thousands by end of the month if nothing is being done now."
11282,10158110942432100,its no joke if you got infected by covid. Once you got infected even u are cured it will be a long term health issue moving forward. Whether vaxxed or unvaxxed are advise not to expose yourselves too much in public for your own benefits. 乖乖stay at home especially the vaxxed don't act hero. Now the unvaxxed are being more cautious than the vaxxed. Don't bother who vax or who didn't vax anymore please.

Rely on something unreliable?

When it doesn't stop transmission at all (vaccinated infection rate exceeded vaccinated population ratio of 80% already), and serious illness in the vaccinated has already started climbing (around 50% of those requiring oxygen support are vaccinated)?

Better start worrying now before you realize the vaccine doesn't protect you at all.

11413,10158509027117900,"we shall wait and see how much deaths will come from fully vaxx , cases and someone will get backfired for not easing measurements, no country garmen dare to ease except for SG, we are really unlucky right now speechless"
11414,10158509088512900,That’s the way. Those who are scared just stay at home etc. Don’t impose your fears on those who want to live normally. Life goes on.
11415,10158509132512900,"Still don’t learned from lessons , before lockdown govt says masks are not necessary, then sudd need.

Ask to lockdown boarders, but didn’t listen and let em in, then cause a spike

Now ? Just Keep cool and deal with it 😎"
11416,10158509156437900,"How’s the children are they spare? School measurement is not clear to the parents, cases is found and cleaning perform after few days, and no one informing the parents until then. Is this the right measurement?"
11417,10158509109782900,"Yes 80% vaccinated , now many unlink case. Many employee given 14days quarantine Order, mess up working routine and operation …
Those staffs daily did ART test , result negative , also get 14days QO…
Mr Wong , can MOH review the QO policy."
11418,10158509132092900,The best defence is to attack. Conquer fear. Move ahead without fear. Keep on hesitation or wait n see are the worst scenario. Open up is the best defence.
11419,10158509301322900,"I think this is a very irresponsible way of saying coming from a minister. If you don‘t have a better solution, just admit it."
11420,10158509012837900,Says Lawrence Wong ... we the citizens have no say at all. :(
11421,10158509013537900,Then why still need to wear mask since we are living with Covid
11422,10158509451442900,Perhaps the ministers and experts have no children of their own.
11423,10158509016677900,"An idol of mine once said ""Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him.""

So far I only see copper sheets and aluminium foils."
11424,10158509026147900,"Tighten kpkb, loosen kpkb. 😂"
11425,10158509157142900,Whether your vaccinated or not we're still not safe..that's what we can Say..
11426,10158509324392900,"The article states DG said no new ICU case since 21 Aug but we will continue with agressive testing to prevent chance of overwhelming our medical resources.
This to me is somewhat contradictory. While i agree with agressive testing as proactive strategy then a decision has to be made not to disclose infection numbers. Only ICU cases should be communicated. Its back tracking and definitely not in line with us living with Covid-19."
11427,10158509110152900,Live with the virus. The virus will not go off instead new variant will come. We just need to caution and be social responsible. Do take care and please stay safe. 🙏🙏🙏
11428,10158509154257900,"How about those kids /babies/
newborn? Those below 12 years old are innocent but have highest risk to get this virus.. U never mentioned anything about those below 12 y.o. this is the biggest concern"
11429,10158509072072900,"since like that..can we don't wear mask ...no need trace together..no need distancing..heh
e.."
11430,10158509121607900,"Yes, high vaccination rate. How about children below 12 and those not vaccinated?
To you, it’s only a number."
11431,10158509021837900,"All those kpkb one shld go find a cave and hide la, in tat way u all will be very safe"
11432,10158509020947900,Going back on their words. Already reached 80% or more. Useless.
11433,10158509127682900,Until they figure out vaccination and number of cases are independent of each other.....
11434,10158509039472900,"Where are the unlinked cases coming from and how many are asymptomatic???
Don't you feel that there is complacency among people?"
11435,10158509362502900,"I think we are practically more concerned about the young children.
But well, I think we can only seek God to protect them.
🙏"
11436,10158509025667900,Why I feel tht our country is testing whether 80% vaxinnated population can contain these virus?
11437,10158509099032900,Coming from ppl we depend on for the safety of a country.. This is disappointing and heartless.
11438,10158509041457900,Last time also say. No need wear mask.
11439,10158509019917900,"Wait till virus is found to become more contagious, it's too late. If the virus early strain can disable people's senses, what is this enemy we are fighting?"
11440,10158509034587900,Hmm then open all recreation and allow no limit in dine in lor since u so confident
11441,10158509058782900,"If that is the case, then should also open up pubs and disco.... why never open up since most of people had already been vaccinated..."
11442,10158509050487900,"Maybe this is the correct thing to do.
But, It's actually quite scary, I believe most of us don't want to be part of the statistics. Lol"
11443,10158509108022900,No where on earth is safe. Let’s embrace delta variant together and move on with our lives 😂
11444,10158509098192900,"Should take all the infants, toddlers and pupils into consideration as well."
11445,10158509097857900,"Really, so confirmed no locked down, then why limit to 2 ppl at hawker center?"
11446,10158509012302900,Just make sure that is never too late 🤫
11447,10158509041522900,Yay! Can’t wait for my personal oxygen tank & ventilator! I promise not to accidentally throw the letter😉
11448,10158509032412900,"Minister Wong
Since we have achieved 80% vaccination wonder when can dinning be open up for us to have 4-5 persons at hawker center as of now 2 is very tough

Should allow at least 4 to a table to those who are already vaccinated and Ambassadors can anytime check on us if Ministries still cannot trust us
Restaurant dinning is pretty expensive and as such please do consider to open up more as family members need to eat together

Family who pray and dine together will stay forever

Thank you for taking time to read our comments and feedback 🤣😘❤️"
11449,10158509173457900,"We should stop voluntary testing. Its like checking the bP machine every one hour when u are told u have hypertension.

And stop group size restrictions. It clear now it has no impact on infection rates in an early stage of endemic setting. All it does is imbalances the country and creates unnecessary anguish.

The 2 crucial numbers we
must always focus on is iCU and vaccination rate.

Its time we leave to us a country to make it our own responsibility to keep ourselves safe and healthy through our collective actions."
11450,10158509138452900,"why not increase house visits back to 8 then? Vesak Day, Deepavali and Christmas is coming.

""We did it before, and we'll do it again.
See this Island..."""
11451,10158509119617900,Virus spreading across public transport network is worrying. Need an immediate contingency plan in the event the infection across public transport system goes out of control.
11452,10158510023767900,"I am not sure making such comment is naive or stupidity. Look at the U.K. , they have more than 80% vaccinated rate much early than us. Also population is much spread out geographically,
yet cases spike. Provided our dense population, ppl hardly practice social distancing . So don’t use we have 82 vaccinated rate as an excuse to jeopardise our public health. Look at how the government update us on WhatsApp. They put the total COVID cases at the end now instead of the beginning like before. It is not the solution to divert our concern. Wake up, you are putting our efforts down the drain"
11453,10158509365322900,"children under 12 is vulnerable group , need to address this quickly"
11454,10158509484797900,The remaining 20% and the children below 12 should not go out as they remain vulnerable surrounding with the spreading virus
11455,10158509340712900,"If you don't like the decisions made by the government, buy lots of instant noodles & toilet papers & stay at home. Other people need to exercise outdoor, do real job & contribute to the society."
11456,10158509485502900,"Bring your family old to baby stay with the Covid positive for few months, result ok , then safe to all. No one can guarantee what happens next but be very careful ."
11457,10158510330092900,"100% agree with Mr Wong. Time to get on with it. We’ve got to reunite families, open up our businesses, support our hawker centres, get sport back on before we end up with an obesity crisis and critically, reopen health care services that have been curtailed over the past 18 months. Now we have a mainly vaccinated population, you need to manage your own risks. If you are fearful, don’t go out. But the rest of the world is getting on with it and we need to too. 🇸🇬🔥"
11458,10158509381917900,"We just gotta learn to live with covid 19! If really scared, stay home, stay hungry and stay crazy. Life goes on!"
11459,10158509456877900,Then he should also suggest no ART test for taxi and phv drivers this 1st of October...you realised many does not want to be vaccinated for good reasons and how troublesome the ART tests are...?
11460,10158510021057900,Make Mustafa Center 24 hrs again then. Make my life so difficult need to buy things before 11pm 😑
11461,10158509295277900,"Since we are starting to live with covid, why we still have restriction at hawker centers, dine-in etc ..."
11462,10158509375802900,"To live or not to live with Covid, all say by garment. not we say. We got no say."
11463,10158509132347900,Might as well have no restrictions and back to pre covid level..
11464,10158509486417900,"We lockdown for 2 mth this year is pointless, nth have changed"
11465,10158509198642900,What about children that are not vaccinated coz they are not suitable? 😡
11466,10158509797972900,"It’s pointless getting paranoid and accusing the authorities of not doing anything. We are in the endemic stage now. Just learn to live with the virus in our midst and carry on with our lives as normally as we can. For those who have yet to be vaccinated, please do so as soon as you can."
11467,10158509208792900,"some people don't realise Covid is a death sentence to unvaccinated kids and toddlers who are immunocompromis
ed... if we can only hear their little voices in these comments..."
11468,10158509244337900,"Noted, cases number doesn't matter won't tighten Now is COS high vaccination rate. So next few mth the rate definitely higher than now. So pls don't twist word n call for a CB or HA and say due to spike in cases👌"
11469,10158509022632900,"Are we ready to live with 500, 1000, 2000 or even more cases per day? 🤔"
11470,10158509202187900,"No easing of restrictions for now is a good move.
So long as don’t open close open close."
11471,10158509409382900,"You dnt hide behind n ask us dnt worry. Why don't step out, like us take public transport, n eat at hawker centre. We have to work n earn living for incomes. Further more why the mp dnt to meet the people session? You are the one who say, we must live with the codvic 19 right? Where r your MP? Come out like us."
11472,10158509181637900,"This virus is much more killing n contagious n there is no cure. Dont sweep problem under blanket just for ease of resolving problem. What if that someone who is abt struggling to survive in ICU is somepne close to u, would this decision be a regretful one?"
11473,10158509219427900,"Pls tell BCA the same as well.
And your other statutory board members as well.
Administrative stuff are putting up pressure on working ppl"
11474,10158510075757900,Then what's the point of everyone wearing mask and social distancing since as government said we can live with covid. All nightlife place can open up as well then. When people start dropping like flies then they will realise is too late.
11475,10158509157382900,"Minister Wong
Is it able to open for max 8 pax to play badminton game or other else sport activities? Since vaccination rate have already achieved to 80%?"
11476,10158509497822900,"Tighten complain, don’t tighten also complain. Got job complain, no job also complain."
11477,135320578806504,Idk I get this feeling if we don't tighten soon things are going to get out of hand quickly. These viruses spread exponentially so could be trouble brewing
11478,10158509185637900,Look at Malaysia. At 20k cases they are unfazed and still want to open border with us with request for allowing daily commuting. So we should not be so concern with infection numbers. The only fear is when other countries start to issue travel advisory and impose quarantine upon return from spore is our concern. As that will isolate us further.
11479,10158509234447900,Maybe he should take bus and let someone cough/sneeze right in front of him... he talks only
11480,10158510119292900,I do believed many Sporeans are eyeing on the daily community and unlinked cases. If the daily cases go up then I think it is obvious that many people will be very frighten
11481,10158509935507900,Fully vaccinated doesn’t equate to being immune so it’s better to keep the restrictions in place and continue to monitor and adjust. We have been on the guard for so long.. just bear with it.
11482,10158509087847900,Wear mask and faceshield at the same time. Sure will reduce transmission.
11483,595551958482782,"I am happy with high vaccination rate , but now I am in doubt about the vaccination, we seeing number getting higher each day , are we on the right move."
11484,10158509110352900,With Will Power and 80% vaccination We will be invincible!!!
11485,10158509295092900,Good idea sir because if u keep on lockdown nothing will happen n ur economywill suffer n us also foreign workers too
11486,10158509414722900,They betting that ppl would stay home themselves so no need payout $$
11487,10158509225582900,"Since its endemic, remove mask wearing, quarantine for confirmed cases and their close contacts. After all, PM said at National Day Rally that everyone will get covid sooner or later."
11488,10158509021172900,How about mandating ventilators for every household and ownself cure ownself????
11489,10158509475652900,How about kids and those that cannot be vaccinated ?!!
11490,10158509625462900,Please I have an infant and small kids. Spare considerations for this group of people.
11491,10158509236657900,This is basically beta testing for the future. How can we cope with lifting restrictions and surge in cases. England and Italy is a good example. It's precarious but a cautious progressive approach.
11492,561737151916398,Since there is no need to tighten and we have to live with it then open everything why is there still a need to restrict this and that?
11493,10158509084487900,So that task force went back on their own words that there will be a Stage 2 in early Sep. Wait a few weeks? Some businesses would have died.
11494,10158509101152900,You say what then what lor… since when is what we say matters
11495,10158509325132900,If Live with convid why don’t we all just quarantine ourselves at home if we are infected... can don’t check in entry at shopping mall anymore?
11496,10158509368782900,"U are referring to people that are vaccinated, what about people that not vaccinated and canot vaccinated? What happen to them? They are not singaporean? Still want to wait for someone to die or go to the icu than can start a restriction?"
11497,461648688139672,"Well said Minister, I agree with this."
11498,10158509080757900,"So please allow more number of dine in at coffee shop and hawker center, during work day lunch time no place seat la all after meal still continue seat down chit chat or play hand phone..!"
11499,10158509016087900,Can open KTV?
11500,10158509218702900,Can places that are fully non air conditioned be patronized by non vaccinated folks?
11501,10158509578042900,"When enough of us die off, the survivors will pick up the pieces and move on. Good luck all!"
11502,10158509721217900,"Maybe wait till someone in the Parlimxxx gets it, then they will wake up.
Living with it is now a time game to see when it's their turn.
Heaven has eyes."
11503,10158509178412900,we are worrying about our child not vaccinated. My boy school yesterday rcv have 2 case and just rcv call from enrichment school yesterday 1 case.
11504,10158509419802900,You guys forgot that all our kids under 12 are not vaccinated??
11505,10158509415212900,"Can reopen Airport T1 and T3 for thousands of visitors, shoppers and diners but cannot have more than 2 persons to dine together in food outlets. Stupid decision."
11506,150076013958464,"I believe the situation can be controlled and improved if all of us wear our masks properly(except
when eating or doing other tasks which allow us to remove our masks) and practise safe distancing at all times in public places."
11507,10158509041157900,our transport minister said experts mentioned no evidence from commuters. of course having virus is just like magic....
11508,10158509188612900,"I got 4 kids. Age 3, 2, 1 and 2 months. Yes parent are vaccinated. What Abt my kids. Virus is mutating"
11509,10158509085407900,Government is saying Learn to live with Covid like with flu ...guess hospitals government or private WILL BE CROWDED N hopefully will have enough beds for everyone who need them...
11510,10158509135142900,"Since not required tightening at this stage , when open border ???"
11511,10158510211052900,No easing of restrictions nor tighteni g of restrictions u mean...aiyoh the heading ah all so confusing...
11512,10158509034872900,"I agree with this. Even if there is a need for CB2.0, we should build up our financial reserve first so that we can have a proper lockdown if the need arise."
11513,10158509076892900,So when can open up nightlife? Wait till 100%?
11514,10158509334227900,Live with it. Life still need to move on. Just take care of our own personal hygiene. No need CB & P2HA. Business still need to run.
11515,10158510258637900,The link's heading is totally not what Lawrence Wong mentioned in the press conference. Maybe whoever that posted this need to listen properly
11516,370801461418472,Live with it but hometeam does not allow Safra members to use its facilities like swimming pool
11517,430931785002566,"Be more careful and vigilant because there’s no restrictions,"
11518,10158509073012900,Step 1 is removed TT. Waste of time and resources.
11519,10158509094412900,Does that mean no need trace together anymore?
11520,10158510015142900,I have booked several times sinovac vaccinate for my Mun since august till now no news . What wring .
11521,1470436616656960,It's between being responsive to changing circumstances vs having a one track mind. Where you put your chips determine your gain or loses.
11522,827981271242982,Minister Wong you tell everyone to wear mask but how come you are not wearing one when giving speech in the picture.
11523,10158509228677900,Since we are going to face it like endemics can remove the compulsory RRT or not?? RRT 2 weeks once now plus ART almost every 7 days one test. 🤕
11524,10158509047902900,Finally someone from the MTF made an appearance; thought they MIA.
11525,10158509629972900,When can play 11-A side soccer..?? Since 80% vaccine rate already..
11526,10158509084732900,"Agree, how on earth would we begin the new normal if we were still hoping for Low single digit cases?"
11527,10158509326082900,What about the kids below 12 yrs old?? That's my worry
11528,527202175016184,"Also, maybe it's time to open up social activities from 5 pax to 8 or 10 pax...."
11529,10158509098782900,Interchange cases is on the rise…. hopefully don’t affect the bus drivers.
11530,10158509998122900,At least put back the mandatory of temperature screening 🙏
11531,10158509155137900,Let us live with it.... But precaution goes on...
11532,10158510257122900,"All arrival should do a BA beside swab test.
Those out of quarantine stay will have to do BA everyday for the next 21 days.

I don't see Gov doing that. Is min precautions."
11533,10158510156842900,I only see ambassadors in shopping mall and not hawker or coffee shop .
11534,10158510265917900,Agree with you Sir .. please consider opening borders to traveller who are fully vaccinated too regardless from which country
11535,10158509657872900,"When ktv/fishery, straight away phase downgrade. Now got many clusters plus affected the drivers, no phase downgrade?"

11538,10158509356857900,"Then when can we have chance to visit our home country after years, with a certain chance of return?"
11539,569476014176248,"All these unlinked cases are actually linked, in my opinion, linked to public transport as more and more people go out. We should continue HBL and WFH."
11540,10158509190252900,What about our kids???!! 2yr toddler here
11541,10158509273717900,So high vaccination rate means the hospital volume won’t go up?
11542,10158509157937900,"Ya.. Vaccined enable us to protect our lives, should reopen fully now. All borders open. Back to normal life. The outcome of gradually reopening and fully reopening will be no difference."
11543,10158509083442900,"3rd dose may be coming next year, but MU arrive earlier. How?"
11544,10158510147782900,Children who have not vaccine how?? Notice a lot of children play at playground now.. not worry?!
11545,10158509114242900,"Many unlinked cases these days. Everywhere you go, you are scanned. But has anyone seen MRT and Bus commuters scan in?"

11551,10158509347177900,"“A TOTAL of 5,893 or 30.4% of the 19,378 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours had been fully vaccinated with two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, said Health Ministry director-genera
l Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah.

Of this number, 44 were warded in the intensive care units (ICU), 20 of whom were critically ill in category 5 and needed ventilator support.”

While most of us should have been fully vaccinated, we can’t afford to be complacent."

11679,370793511419267,High vaccination rate is not a good indicator of safety if the majority of unlinked infection cases are breakthroughs of the vaccinated population . It gives people a false sense of safety if they throw caution to the wind when they do silly things feeling that they are untouchable to the virus.

Even if you want us to live with the virus, you also should do something to minmise the rate at which the virus is spreading. Vaccination doesn't mean a bo chap attitude. Why put your citizens at risk?Reminds me of the ""no need to wear mask attitude"" at the onset of this virus. Don't wait for the small fire to become bush fire then you start to panic.

Although, yes, we have to deal with this pandemic n allow economy to return but easing more restrictions r risking numbers to go up.

Some people immune system might not take it.

11723,10158510076807900,Did these 4G jokers communicate to us this will be the plan going forward during the initial vaccination drive? These jokers are just opportunist that twist n turn things to their advantage.
11724,10158510075522900,We just need to get on with life. It is here to stay. The only difference between the vacced & unvacced is personal protection. The increased infections are mostly vacced. They are infecting both vacced and non-vacced. We should not tighten restrictions. If anything we should ease more because C19 & mutations will not go away. Just live with it like the flu. We have more than 500 deaths each year from the different flu mutations.

The last time it was reported that the govt was more worried with the unlinked cases but now ? It seems to me that the govt are care less now because their expectation of the vaccine numbers are more important and already mention to all to make this Covid as endemic in this island.
The most fragile are the senior citizens that do have existing illness on them.

Taking into consideration kids out there have not been vaccinated and numerous elderly may not be suitable for taking the vaccines due to various health reasons perhaps.. all these imply the danger remains. The ever rising number of cases and unlinked cases especially point to the fact something and all are not right nor going as smoothly perhaps.

11969,563818448000991,"Is the Medium+ Mass Vaccinated Singapore (120 doses / 100 people, 49% two doses, 73% one dose - 24 July 2021) heading for a new covid wave and lockdown during the viral low season? Will a significant increase in number of deaths and admittances to hospitals, ICU's and on ventilators follow in line with the significant increase in reported active cases? Should it thus be added to the appendix A below or not?

The answer on 23 August 2021: the Medium+ Mass Vaccinated Singapore is in a new deadly covid wave during the viral low season with 17 deaths versus zero than the same period (August) previous year without mass vaccination. See links at the end of this comment.

The above observation, the exacerbation of the covid pandemic after specific antibody mass vaccination, was and is scientifically the most plausible expected scenario as a result of this mass vaccination. Consequently, this science and the above observation is evidence of a serious violation, among many other serious violations (for example for young healthy people see the end of this comment), of among others the following two rules of the Nuremberg Code:
""
The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.

The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation
and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.
""
See links at the end of this comment. And now they also have plans and already effective implementations
(seen worldwide) to mandate besides luring and forcing the covid mass vaccination!

""
1. According to my insights high transmissibilit
y and of course “It has features that enable escape from the immune system” of the Delta variant are important signs of a serious and dangerous viral immune escape variant driven by specific antibody mass vaccination and by lockdowns! See article links below.

2. Where in the mainstream media are the figures about deaths / cases for fully vaccinated people with maximum antibody level (> 2 weeks after the last dose) in comparison with other groups (unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, …)? I've seen news that the death percentage for the maximum antibody level group would be 6 fold that of the other groups and that antibodies from covid vaccines are less neutralising for the delta variant. See article links below, page 12 of the second link and the first image further down. Is there an increased risk for ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) and antibody mediated enhancement of the disease with this delta and derived variants?
""

Now with appendix A: Articles about and images from mass vaccinated countries with:
– recent surges: viral immune escape and potentially antibody dependent and/or mediated enhancement (these are strong and dangerous worsenings of the disease) variants driven by the specific antibody mass vaccination? What about fully vaccinated people getting infected and dying with the Delta and derived variants with an apparently 6 fold death rate? and
– lockdowns
Mongolia, Seychelles, Bahrain and many more countries to be added to appendix A and with worldwide vaccination and covid situation maps.

Unless that person is totally isolated, once exposed to an infected caretaker or family member, he or she will be ravished by the virus when it passes through. If the vaccines are very very safe for normal elderly persons, then rationally, it is better to get a vaccination.

So much about being grateful to our seniors for building up Singapore; after all, some sacrifices need to be made and are unavoidable. “There are currently 54 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation

12029,10158523038772900,"Before we jump into the third jab, perhaps the following could be illuminating.

Israel DOES NOT use China vaccines at all,
but Israel uses only Moderna+Pfizzer
vaccines, and that is why Israel has record number of daily cases now, and the number of daily cases in Israel is now higher than before vaccination started, and the vast majority of Israel people have already been vaccinated .

The reason for the failure to stop virus spread in Israel and also in Singapore,
is because Moderna+Pfizzer
vaccines, are NOT EFFECTIVE against the delta variant, and the effectiveness will keep dropping every month.

Both Israel and Singapore made the same mistake, of naively and trusting in full, the USA fake news media claim, that wildly overstate the effectiveness of vaccines like Moderna+Pfizzer
vaccines, and the same USA fake news media FALSELY CLAIM that China vaccines are not effective, but in the real world, China vaccines turn out to be the most effective, especially against the Delta variant .

12069,10158532550177900,Hahahaha thought said that HBL not good for students but afterall implement Now! If done so earlier less schools & students will be infected already! Slow decision even when u wan to flip prata! Wait till prata burned liao then flip! Same goes to WFH & community case...
12070,10158532234947900,"""Some"" will say parents not happy still complain. But that ""some"" won't know who will look after their kids especially those primary 1 - 3 kids who are not matured enough.

Not all parents have maids or family members who can help to look after their child.

Hope employers are understanding and be flexible during these period."
12071,10158532510112900,"Aiyoh so many ppl help to make 80% vaccination rate happen by going for vaccine, pushing vaccine, and worst anti those unvax (medical condition, pregnant, etc ) by bullying and discriminate them... indirectly pressuring them through workplace ，social settings, etc... so with high rates of cos they can open up and more virus spread more. .....they dont even need tighten even 900 cases daily....bcos high vaccine rates so u all grumble and unhappy for wad?

If vaccine work why so many cases and infection, if vaccine dont work why encourage bully people to vax...

Bully unvax to have test more and cant eat in this place and tat place ....cant do tis n tat.... purely shameful thing to do.... bullying segregating....
karma do come....

Main point is that unvac wont transmit virus quietly or silently and not as fast.. yet u are testing them more... funny and stupid....way of doing things...."
12072,10158532172997900,"Even if the govt doesn’t make WFH by default, you can request it from your boss. You can also take leave for those HBL days. Most employees have lots of leave days from last year and this. Don’t depend on the govt for everything. This is your life and the govt cannot please everyone. Anyway it is not easy to WFH while juggling kids’ HBL."
12073,10158532375947900,"It's getting very complicated. The health ministry is urging a curb on social activities, STB is reviving the tourism sector. Good for students to stay away from schools for a short period."
12074,10158532181742900,Why are we all not satisfied and asking for more? Implement HBL still got things to say? No HBL said not concerned about children. Got HBL then asked WFH and other smaller kids. What we want??
12075,10158532154412900,"Is this ""living with Covid""? I don't understand the purpose of this when MOH has already established that the virus does not seriously affect children.

If this is done just to stop kids being on QO when it's time for PSLE, that's not very fair on all the students in P1-5. We already know that HBL is a poor substitute for face to face learning."
12076,10158532318857900,"I don't understand the need to wait till 27 september.but whatever it is,I wish all students and parents well. May all of us be safe"
12077,10158532418317900,Pls make WFH as default too. It's definitely worth to implement it now to bring the cases down.
12078,10158533555137900,"Moe so good , then how about early childhood sectors.. I guess it's must be also the same as well ,cos the pre schoolers are also v young and can b v easily attract to virus symptoms as well ...

Esp when we early childhood trs are so short handed that parents keep sending their babies and toddlers to us 😞😑"
12079,10158532203932900,"Thank you MOE! But while I appreciate, why not hire help for teachers? MOH can hire so many swabbers or ambassadors, why MOE doesn't hire help for teachers? Do they?"

y, plus need to work.... serious... our Garments really all got maids, tutors at home rite???? All use backside to think..???????"
12082,10158532239462900,I’ve seen so many kids playing around at the void decks and bus stops in close contacts. It’s like watch a horror movie unfolding. It seems our schools have failed to drum in the dangers of the virus and how to practice good safe distancing.
12083,10158532188802900,Implementing HBL is good but make sure to implement WFH too as some parents can't hire a maid nor get an uncle/aunt to take care of their child.
12084,10158532224872900,"I dunno and dun matter what others think, I feel HBL is definitely better now amidst the exponentially increased of cases everyday. Not the first time doing HBL anyway. Anyway thou the initiative came later , still better than none."
12085,10158532293052900,"For those parents wanting HBL so that they can WFH for reasons they know, government can never ever mandate WFH. Even when 2000 cases daily. Want to WFH, another way is get a QO."
12086,10158532600292900,"End of the day we parents play important role. Stay home. No eating out, no malls outing , no playground. Our children are 1st and foremost parents responsibility.
Let's we all play our part...take care n stay safe all..."
12087,10158532292797900,Should not allow kids go shopping mall and dine-in during HBL and close all playground as well..
12088,10158532212082900,Thought it was originally 27-29 as announced previously and same as last yr? 25/26 is weekend so no change right? But good to know the younger grades r kept safer at home. better than nothing.
12089,10158534417237900,"I’m not sending my P5 daughter to school.
Too risky, not until school carry out periodic weekly or at least fortnightly COVID-19 testing.
Those who pick up your kids at school by yourself and not your maid will understand that there is no safe distancing in school. Primary school students will tend to forget about hygiene or safe distancing once at play.
If my daughter caught it, my whole family gets quarantined and I have to say bye bye to my job. Nothing to WFH for me, manual labour."
12090,10158532946812900,"Shouldn't now be the time to review things like employment act.
During this time, esp.for parents with childrens to complement some sort of leave esp.when their children are on hbl and etc.
Not every employer are understanding.
I admit there's much to be done and since govt.are concern of mental health, this is one of many they should look into"
12091,10158532376777900,Once again we see the complacency and incompetence of our ministers. They are putting our children at risk!
12092,10158533612532900,"30 Sep to 6 Oct... PSLE written papers. P1s to p5s kids already don't need to go to school.

27 Sep to 29 Sep... It was already made known long ago that P6s are on study break. Hence, they won't meet the P1s to P5s anyway.

So this 10 days HBL thing has no impact on P6s at all. There is nothing about this is helping the P6s.

It's just giving the P1s to P5s another 3 days of HBL. That's all."
12093,10158532368127900,How come only primary school kids are so important n they have HBL?? Younger ones like kindergarten ones are very safe to go to school is it? U think of parents who need to go wrk so their kids need to go childcare n kindergarten. Did u guys think of the potential these younger ones to get infected? Preschool teachers? Unfair!!
12094,10158532311077900,"The policies quite confusing, some policies are opening up and some policies are tightening…"
12095,10158532173957900,Yah only psle impt. All the other children esp preschoolers not impt lah.
12096,10158532421432900,"This action should have been taken weeks ago but why only primary schools?

Had this been done, my son's classmate would may not have been infected and his classmates may not be in danger of contracting the virus"
12097,10158542505482900,"Ministry of Education, Singapore I have just received from the school that my daughter had been place under LOA (Pending QO). This is just a few days before the start of PSLE first paper. It is regrettable that my daughter will not be able to take her PSLE paper after so much preparation and adhere to going to school daily because MOE declared that it is very safe. She is emotionally affected after learning that she will not be able to go for the papers after a year long preparation. All her efforts practically went down the drain. In my opinion, this is how badly the covid situation is being managed in school by MOE and MOH. Her whole class was placed on LOA (pending QO). Why is it that they are not allowed to take the exam if they have no symptoms and tested negative? We can have various safe clearance options like ART on the spot or even PCR test. The children should still have the right to take examinations if they are fit to. They can be in isolated room as well but not deny them of their right to sit for the exam. If travellers are able to come into SG with just a PCR clearance test and need not serve QO, why can't the children take exam? I am very sure that my daughter is not the only one feeling disappointed and devastated that her efforts has gone to waste. We will appreciate of MOE and MOH can come up with better alternatives in handling this situation especially for graduating children. Please help them.

CONCERN PARENT"
12098,10158532228707900,Why need to HBL when not even meet our target of 1000 cases. OYK will not be happy as he keep stress not so serious yet n our education minister already can't wait to implement HBL
12099,10158532267092900,"Always waiting till the last minute. And what is this short HBL purpose ? If want to do it , do it all the way. This is neither here or there. Might as well don’t go for HBL.

12100,10158532630897900,Is it only now that the experts realise that students in primary school have siblings in secondary schools or beyond who can bring the virus into their home?
12101,10158532281522900,"Yes, any kind of interval and alternate or rotation will be good strategy."
12102,10158532211957900,"Last time all say close school. Now close, complain y close??"

12107,10158532369222900,"Since the cases are so high, keep the kids safe too… alternate week or alternate days do HBL for preschoolers…. Minimize their movements so dat they are not in school the whole week…"
12108,10158532159897900,Finally Taskforce doing something.
12109,10158532162207900,Makes sense when PSLE is happening there’s lesser ppl in the school. Less disruption. Similar to GCE.

12111,10158532269337900,Can they also declare PH for working adults… WFH and “Study Break” cannot be together one …
12112,10158532177697900,"For once CCS did the right thing to prevent things from getting worse… as for OYK, that one is a disappointment claiming it is within their expectations when they already lost control."
12113,10158532161347900,"You need to complement WFH with HBL. Heard sm students couldn't take their PSLE oral ysday due to QO. So I presume there's a spread among students already but G is still sticking to ""there's NO EVIDENCE that the bus captains hv spread the virus/variants to the commuters"" story.

Edit : PSLE listening comprehension*"
12114,10158532259647900,having our hospital and icu at the lowest point is great and a job well done by our task force. Don’t say that they have not done their job or they have not done well. everything everytime there will be new thing to learn when fail we go back to basic and think to get better. Plus even if the task force put in strict rules there still be plp breaking it. So in all is everybody job to keep Singapore safe not only the task force. Let remember a children hood cartoon Captain Planet. Let our power combine to make Singapore a better place to stay.
12115,10158532216687900,"Our task force lost in direction lah, one hand asking people stay home, other hand invite tourist here to walk around, Com Chest Singapore even organises walk outdoor… same thing goes to testing, asking companies and everyone to do self test, but part time food deliver and private drivers NO NEED. They have so much contact with others, and most part time work almost everyday. LOL. I heard lalamove riders and drives are exempted from testing LOL SOOOOO SPECIAL HAHAHAHAH"

12210,10158141435222100,This is so ridiculous. Border measures are relaxed for people from overseas to return to see their loved ones but residents are denied to visit their loved ones who are sick in the hospitals.
12211,10158141478767100,I'm frustrated with MTF. If you only bring down the cases Singaporeans will not go through this. My mom will be going for op this Saturday...I can't even visit her. MTF please wake up...
12212,10158141519157100,What nonsense is this? So now u restrict people from visiting patients in the hospital while open borders big big for others to come in? And not giving people information about clusters or cases at all? This dun make sense ok? Pity those who need to undergo treatment without their family by the side. Also hope this system wont crash one day whereby people who are non covid needing treatment are turned away cos there is not enough beds.
12213,10158141555617100,"82% vaccinated and we are in this disgraceful situation because there is no one steering the ship. Our MTF only waiting to see what other countries are doing instead of having their own initiatives And plan.

That is what happens you only rely on those leaky vaccines to do the job. Every day harping about unvaccinated instead of doing something more positive to arrest the fully vaccinated explosion of cases and the Fully vax increase of seriously ill that we are seeing."
12214,10158141619087100,It is evident that the healthcare system is at breaking point. Hospital beds were lacking even pre covid. A&E was a 3-5 hour wait with no beds pre covid. So how could we cope? Just because the Govt says it is endemic doesn’t mean the infrastructure problems go away. It is a systemic issue and the sick are unable to go to hospitals now for treatment.
12215,10158141466102100,"Just cannot imagine if more of our health care team are infected by virus
It will be extremely difficult to manage the sick people without having adequate nurses in all the hospitals ."
12216,10158146987527100,Are our Nurses and Doctors wearing proper PPE like how Malaysia and China Nurses and Doctors wearing? I hope they can take care and protect themselves well before they can protect patients. Otherwise Nurses and Doctors will be short handed if they will to be infected.
12217,10158141714087100,"The already burnout Healthcare Frontliners and backend workers and their families have to sacrifice more now due to living with epidemic policy. At this rate, our public Healthcare system might collapse any time. The morale of those working in the Healthcare sector is gonna hit rock bottom. Take care. Stay safe."
12218,10158141718112100,1 month period of no visitation isn't gonna make much a difference. It's going to be a pattern. What's the point if it's supposed to be living in an endemic?
12219,10158141493942100,"Question, so our authorities are okay with borders being open, okay with big crowds in public transports, but not okay with hospital visits?

What foolish logic is this?? 🤔"

r stop the borders and tidy up internally first..."
12223,10158141472807100,Sick of this government task force. It is because of ill management that it has led to this.
12224,10158141515537100,"Just live with it ma... since MTF can't handle the situation.
Later close here close there number case balloon to 2000-3000.
But border still open right ?"
12225,10158142248217100,"What nonsense is this?? Hospital cannot visit and limited to 1 visitor unless patient in critical condition, due to number increasing. But the border can still open by taking more higher risk and inviting more huge number of unknown covider in. So which mean in order to open border on time and have to sacrifice hospital visitors?????"
12226,10158141447922100,can someone explain how letting people into our country and blocking citizens from visiting hospitals is logical?
12227,10158141407802100,"Border can open, hospital cannot visit. What logic"
12228,10158141657827100,"Some brains are just stuck at playing the numbers game. Without any consideration of practicalities n the immediate real issue on hand. They can keep insisting their predicted numbers are correct, so what?? And at what cost??These are human lives n for the rest of the fortunate ones who are not YET sick, emotional health are also prices to pay as a result of such incompetencies,
inhumanity and totally egoistic and short sighted mindset."

12235,10158142066612100,"Why only now,? Saw a group of three to four people at hospital last week at a&e , coming in n out, one group even accompany an able person inside,,was wondering why such was allowed. The task force shd hv introduced this earlier. also if polyclinics are crowded,do they hv back up plan B??how many are allowed to accompany? Kindly look into this too for polyclinics, library"

Very soon, Moh also infected."
12243,10158141461452100,some clinics do not even follow social distancing rules because people like to bring the entire kampung for outpatient visits.

12261,10158141990237100,"tbh why can’t whoever came up with the policy see this happening? Everyone was urging MOH to revisit the differentiated policy at least in the hospital where we have the most vulnerable patients. Isn’t it common knowledge that those who are fully vaccinated can be infected and would have the ability to spread the virus. So why were fully vaccinated excluded from ART…? The silly differentiated approach obviously serve no purpose in the hospital. Were we just following the set of rules blindly, just because everywhere else is applying the same?"

When gov said people can go back to work, employers will call the employee back to justify the rental paid despite the fact that those employees can work equally well from home.

Ambassador are there checking on the safe entry and asking which stall you are going. But they did not enforce the people to wear mask after meal or discourage people from hoarding seats , talking to one another without mask. Hence, restricting to 2 people is one solution, enforcing the need to wear mask after meal and avoid long hours of chatting at market is required. I know people need to talk and stay in touch. But sitting opposite to one another and talking with one another without mask is unwise. Stay vigilant and resilient mean to obey to the requirements to protect one another.

12408,10158542129032900,Reducing dining from 5 to 2 is not going to work. The problem lies with close contacts with covid positive cases. Most are not contacted by MOH personnel for a mandatory test and these people are still heading out and socialising therefore a spike in your daily numbers.

12421,10158542127462900,Actually dine in should not be allowed in the first place
12422,10158542117742900,"This don’t affect me, cos all these years I eat alone. Expand to 5ppl gathering, I’m still a loner. What’s the different?"
12423,10158542915342900,"Why the sudden change,better not allow to dine in just tabao last time when cases were low cannot dine in now cases surge can???????"
12424,10158542088572900,See for yourself at East Coast Park during weekend...
12425,10158542130397900,Must do a full circuit breaker again or else what the purpose doing repeatly open and close again ?
12426,10158542021992900,Again too slow in reacting……
12427,10158542038727900,At least they did something before it goes totally off course
12428,10158542033272900,Won't help much.
12429,10158542047862900,Seriously do they really think the cases are due to the dining in ? keep playing with 5 to 2 then 2 to 5...
12430,10158542187132900,A prudent measure in the light of mounting infections in the community. Don't let the 2000 number trigger off a circuit breaker.
12431,10158542023872900,"Any possibility of restriction updates on Trace Together app? This way, we don't have to search high & low for the ever-changing restrictions 😐"
12432,10158542193907900,Nothing works...virus do not navigate by just changing of numbers n rules. I will still follow the rules anyway.
12433,10158542027332900,"Not much affect , Coffee shop & Hawker already 2 per table 😂😂😂😂😂"
12434,10158542042367900,"Why do this when the numbers go up, could have done it earlier? Flip prata how many times until chaoda"
12435,10158542021662900,"With expected cases soaring to hit over 2000, is this the best you can do after opening up confidently? Didn’t you guys claimed can handle the situations? Poor F&B sectors, staff and suppliers etc suffer again 😔"
12436,10158542045392900,If it getting very serious the Circuit Breaker measures will kick in. Just wait and see how MOH going to make it happen
12437,10158543237652900,"I sympathetise with the F&B outlets, especially the restaurants. They were relieved when govt allowed 5 diners (from 2) but sadly, their joy was shortlived and this is not the first time. How does govt expect them to survive at this rate?"
12438,10158542104562900,A measure comes too late. Slowing down the speed of transition but cannot contain the spread like the recent forest fires 🔥🔥🔥
12439,10158542021747900,Now than want to listen to nitizens cap at 2 after the hugh spread but never too late to see will the cases drop
12440,10158542285567900,"Finally admitting that the increase in cases is due to the 5 pax F&B dine-in? If not why reduce to 5 while coffee shops never reduce?
Why don’t they reveal where the cases get infected from their marvellous TT contact tracing app? Must be very damning to the vaccinated if not they sure blast loud loud that the non-vax are spreading the virus."
12441,10158542263262900,"Can we please activate nationwide testing, esp. cluster areas whether big or small, & also activate cleaning companies/
services to disinfect all public areas? All it takes is 1 (with or without symptoms) to spread to many. Consider safe distancing in public transportation too. And continue the reporting of all clusters, not just big ones, and graphical updates, incl. maps, where covid cases are. Safety, health & wellbeing of everyone is very important."
12442,10158542679132900,"This is akin to a Dr prescribing only paracetamol the wonder pill to all patients who have fever, without checking what causes the fever."
12443,10158542285462900,"Loving this circus of a show.
Can't wait to get a good laugh at y all when this is over.lol."
12444,10158542085702900,"Yes finally there are some tightens restrictions to curb the spread, I only hope the situation will get better🙏"
12445,10158542440262900,"I recognise that street..Holland
Village."
12446,10158542129232900,"Is oke 2 pax allowed just dont lockdown again,we are living together with covid 19 right, then just do it together"
12447,10158542026247900,Why don't we just enforce the mask?
12448,10158542404572900,"Wa Lao…if decision open up, then open up as endemic. Don’t give half bake implements without solution caused health care and F&B suffering. This is a really bad plan & no backup solution with poor crisis management"
12449,10158543773252900,Can go out in group of 8 then if want to eat just split into 4 groups of 2.
12450,10158542408932900,Soon this roti prata govt will announced no dine out again .we tired of this flip flop directions
12451,10158542038042900,Where’s the grassroots people at? Feel the pain keep getting flipflop from the mmtf ? F&b must be feeling played out by the mmtf.
12452,10158543490257900,Might as well ban dining in and mask off activities completely for 1 month. Now like not here nor there.
12453,10158545178127900,"I feel that CB will not solve this current problem. In fact we should practise LJ - Lone Journey. Everyone should travel alone, eat alone."
12454,10158542155172900,"No dine in for all F&B outlets, hawkers and coffeeshops, better than downsize to 2 again."
12455,10158542114607900,How to enforce?
12456,10158542727557900,The hospital can't handle the current infection so stay home recovering?
12457,10158542499372900,Better create more temporary medical facilities to treat and house light symptoms COVID-19 people..
12458,10158542166822900,Can Govt set up multiple drive thru testing lane please to minimise risks?
12459,10158542053972900,How cb u action also at last u have to lock down sooner than later... kb lah
12460,10158542104847900,Eh not opening up anymore?
12461,10158542143897900,Huge thanks to Healthcare & frontline people who are under immense pressure under these trying times. Grateful to govt for coming up with these restrictions which will hopefully reduce the pressure. Let's all do our part to be socially responsible to fight this horrible Delta.
12462,10158542016782900,But casino still open?
12463,10158542088247900,No change to kopitiam and hawker centre dinning?
12464,10158542528487900,"Finally they decided to implement HA. Sokay everyone they always implement it late and I'm used to it but at least they are doing it. Confirm there will be idiots who want to enjoy ""last moment"" to dine in with 5 pax. It's time for us to play our part the moment govt implement this! Agree with some of you saying that they should impose it earlier but well we are not ministers so our voices are not that important right 🤷"
12465,10158542179712900,"Thank arh, now can see many restaurants sure close down tis time! U oreadi plan endemic but hw come restrictions still killing businesses heavy? Dun be a joke pls😝 over 2k cases tonite rite?"
12466,10158542051117900,MRT n bus no limit
12467,10158542584102900,Why always penalise F&B when there is no cluster from F&B?
12468,10158542104032900,Gym reduced to 2 also?
12469,10158542166257900,"If there is no strict checking at the markets or coffeeshops, the spreading will just continue…
If they sit there eat long long and chit chat, the risk is definitely higher to catch the virus than strike lottery or Toto !!!

Pls Tabao your food to protect your vulnerable elderly and young kids in your family… Stay Safe, Everyone !"
12470,10158542134262900,This is not back to norm...

12514,10158542017517900,Circuit breaker would be good.
12515,10158542121392900,Actually restaurants are very stringent in complying. Unlike coffeeshops and hawker centers and other crowded places.
12516,10158542042162900,If they had listened to the people's voice of not organising NDP gathering this would not have happened.
12517,10158542110537900,This is the best move the highly paid elites can made?
12518,10158542401457900,All shop should close by 11pm no dine in after 11pm no 24hrs

12523,10158542061167900,"All these people commenting that the tightens restrictions come too late, you guys also keep happily going out during this period what??

So don’t be a hypocrite now and comment that such actions are too late. You also didn’t do your own part.

You cannot ask for tightens restrictions when you yourself still keep going out. What you truly want is for others to stop going out so they you can continue to go out. This is just being selfish and hypocritical."
12524,10158542034887900,"Ohhh, a lot of people very happy liao. The ones who keep asking the gov to lockdown have gotten their wish. No complaints liao hor... do also kpkb, don't also kpkb. Enough liao hor.
The situation is fluid, see situation and decide on measures. If endemic right now cmi, then next steps lah. Why always must say people flip prata? Then they take no action because they don't wanna flip then we all die???"

But now regardless whether you are completed your full vaccination or not have to comply to 2 person rules . Due to over confident of the 83% vaccination rate , it’s seem that the government is experimenting with our own local singaporean lives by switching on & off the phase button … Maybe , next experiment , the government may apply and allow 5 person for dinning outside after completed their “ Booster Shot “ and see what happen next …!!!"

So many calls from Singapore citizens to ask them to lock down and slow things down but they didn’t listen.

Many suffered from these and try to go hospital. But considered not urgent. Oh well...so much for ""decades"" of preparation and readiness since SARS..."
12591,10158542145102900,The government like Pfizer is telling lies lah. Why don't they release the age and risk profiles of those seriously ill vaccinated patients? Always emphasizing on old and sick unvaccinated people ! How about those who were vaccinated and have mild symptoms they probably don't need the vaccines too!
12592,10158542141502900,Stay home.
12593,10158542139522900,Now many just want to admit into hospital though mild symptoms. Hope those warded in hospitals has no visitors and more importantly no internet access. So they can all rest 100% and some may want to rest at home.

12597,10158542136332900,"The root cause was rushing into it because it was already planned for after ND Rally

At that time the active clusters had extended deep into the heartlands, esp in the southwest bt merah area and the central tpy region

But the health min was characteristica
lly only interested in KPIs

Now the whole jing gang has created the conditions that led to deaths of both vaccinated and unvaccinated, students who missed exams, workplaces with complete missing teams and hundreds of anxious households with no support in their home quarantine

Whoever ‘expert’ and opinion influencers like C C***g are directly responsible for the lies that covid is now a flu

When in the history of Sg has a flu led to patients in tentage in the carparks of hospitals?
How can anyone with eyes and heart say this is just a flu knowing this hospital situation? knowing how much covid treatment cost? knowing that a confirmed percentage will get long term effects?"

12896,10158583481507900,Stabilisation Phase another extended month still may not work as it daily increasing trend 5K mark new cases infections. It will only overstress our healthcare system & workers as well as continue home recovery program.
12897,10158582472877900,"He highlighted three “positives”, including the number of cases stabilising over the last two weeks.” I am shocked that this is considered as “positive” … we used to have single digit, double digit and triple digit. Of late it has been thousands!!!! Where is the logic???"
12898,10158582393152900,I only know MTF thinking hard on how to name all the different phases and the word to use on the reasoning on covid death. Other than that they are irrelevant and unqualified for the tasks!
12899,10158582369597900,"From flatten the curve, to wait for vaccinations, to now just wait for...? There's nothing else to wait for already. What nonsense is the government doing at this point."
12900,10158582473347900,"Looks like the light at the end of the tunnel has been moved.. 😢
Doing the same things over and over again and expect a different result is insanity !"
12901,10158582375467900,This 4 jokers need to step down n resign. 🤡
12902,10158582953187900,"Ownself swab ownself isolate, no quarantine order, I think some stubborn one will still go out even they are positive, close contact and those who positive without symptoms will spread to others without knowing. If government don’t conduct check perform swab on close contact, the light of the tunnel will be further away towards darkness"
12903,10158582607737900,"Its basically a trial and error strategy now.
This is not uncommon when you don't have the experienced subject matter experts to lead and manage a crisis.
Don't have the specific expertise and experience so just observe how other countries handle the situation and apply their strategies hoping the situation will improve but not taking into account difference in population and behavior profiles."
12904,10158582377107900,Help our livelihood in the uncertainty of infection n reframed from work Al least a week. Not easy for some off us people
12905,10158582387077900,When election they talk so sweet they care for the senior citizens all the true colour is out everyone can see..😡
12906,10158583126157900,Apparently the current measures does not really work. More and more death daily and more and more cases. So will it make any different to extend the restrictions?
12907,10158582463542900,This MTF realli useless shut for two week and bring dwn the case . Not here nor there . Wth
12908,10158582468752900,Admit the system is a failure
12909,10158582365152900,"The extension of restrictions is really unfair for those celebrating Deepavali/
Diwali on 4 November!! I really hope the Ministry of Health, Singapore loosens some restrictions in view of the upcoming festival/
public holiday."
12910,10158582479562900,It is obvious that the restrictions are not working and i think they should come with new measures instead of extending it..
12911,10158582406222900,"I still don't understand why still extend and still WFH. Students still go to school and VTL open for travel , so why can't they go back to work ? Now government protect who ? Very confusing. 85% Vaccianted and yet number shoot up so high WHY ? Please do something & not just doing the extend."
12912,10158582387277900,All they need to do is lockdown for 2mths and you will see the result.
12913,10158582385942900,If we can't even sit to eat at outdoor Hawkers Centre & Coffee Shops. How are we even going to live with the covid? If MTF or expert worried that these places are the cause of how the virus spread... then chances are that this will not revert back and live with Covid.😷
12914,10158582455672900,Good luck to all those who are week. God bless us all. Shut the front door tightly and open the back door widely at the same time.
12915,10158582420507900,Minister Wong needed exactly 48 hours to contradict Minister Ong in the messaging. Flip flop continues. Data and facts are not driving the discussion
12916,10158582482012900,"Look like their plan doesn’t work and not ready to reopen, now more spread in communities and pressure on medical staffs, include hospitals bed and ICU."
12917,10158582387157900,"This restriction had been inplaced for a month, cases still increases everyday so what is the point of extending instead new measures should be inforced."
12918,10158582397947900,We have reached to this gold standard in just 3 weeks. This gold standard now extended till 21Nov. Very Jialat but not admitting. Just re-arranging the words to change the meaning. How to believe that !.
12919,10158583210942900,Hope we don't end up in situation like dr have to make a decision either to save a life or give up another.
12920,10158582458247900,"Why I always feel something wrong with Minister Ong statement? ART positive then stay at home for recovery, how do ministry know how many cases out there? Then say cases number stabilise? You look at that number you happy enough ah?"
12921,10158583212662900,Then why allowing tourists to come to Singapore cos of money government needs. Fool discussion from fools.
12922,10158582565622900,"Patience. More vaccinated will survive even if they catch the virus. Open economy Sg will survive. Open dining (though restricted), restaurant will continue to survive. VTL is open for all to travel if feel stifled."
12923,10158582498142900,Do u know What is wrong here ? Why extend the same restriction without tightening or new measures ?The existing measure is not reducing cases but getting more cases. What do u say to MTF ?
12924,10158584081827900,"In the first place the PAP has created the Bottle neck which they assumed that it will not affects our health care system. PAP you fail again and again, is totally unacceptable and Is a joke to the world."
12925,10158582728487900,"No vax lower covid case…85% vax more covid case😂😂… told us to treat it as an endemic but yet they still treat it as a pendemic😂..Social gathering only at 2 but buses and MRT are still pack…Still not enough,now open leg to tourist but close leg to sg citizens…Dont you just love our highly paid minister😂👍 without them sg will be doom😂😂…"
12926,10158582665082900,"Seems like the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" belong to the headlights of a truck driving into the tunnel."
12927,10158582448182900,"Hahaha,a health minister who doesn't know about health is not a health minister n should have resigned already."
12928,10158582516292900,"I have already said, if you want to see different results, you must boldly do it completely differently"
12929,10158582712572900,"Temporary stop VTL till situation stabilizes...

Money can be earned later, but not the lives of our people...

And to MTF, please have a look on the ground to understand the situation. Some of your initiatives, albeit with good intentions and look good on paper, are not implementable on the ground.

Please review the current SMMs and Vaccination Policy.

And allow online public dialogues to engage citizens meaningfully instead of closed-door press conferences which is of no use to the public."
12930,10158584086037900,Yeah well done our ministers 👏🏼 your KP I confirm reached. Hey 61% sure you all very happy

12932,10158582539172900,"Created the problem in the first place. Bad decision-making
and the frontline workers now have to bear the consequences. This Taskforce seriously need to wake up their idea and make a public apology!"
12933,10158582461452900,"They opened for travellers, so incoming cases will add on to the ""already"" overwhelmed local cases. This part they still observing. One question, do incoming cases receive medical attention at hospital once tested positive whilst locals (age range) all home recovery? If so, meaning hospitals still hv space but just reserved for incoming cases only?? Or same as locals, come at your own risk? 🤔 This part i didnt get to read. Anyone?"
12934,10158582392467900,"One side extend stabilization phase, the other side VTL continue to open door to other country. No sense."
12935,10158582416722900,"We always see the elites using extremely nice adjectives to defray attention....or
rather coverups..."

Then word came to the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne and laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; do not let them eat, or drink water."

It is very immature to still insist on politics when lives are lost in double digits daily. And testing asymptomatic people in high numbers is not helping as America and other countries will follow suit to warn their people against travelling to sg.

Countries like HK have high population but they handled it better than you did because your biggest mistake was to continue to allow South Asians to visit sg on visitor passes and the short duration of the SHN has resulted in infections in malls etc and probably resulted in high infections in dorm now.

It is very simple, compare what you did and what countries who handle it better not do, then you will get the clear answers on what went wrong. It is time to eat the humble pie.

The 1st stabilisation phase is a nice way to tell us it’s a failure. The 2nd extension is telling us it’s still is a failure.

Failure of endemic conditions precedent:
1. Rt value too high.
2. Number of discharge < daily infections
3. Infection rates increasing exponentially
4. Country ability to cope with virus not yet sufficient

Experts wrong. Decisions base on experts not correct so far

Implications
1. Economy more affected than July
2. More People continue getting covid
3. More Deaths

Likely reasons
Removal of tracking “linked” and “unlinked” cases and dependent only on vaccinations

Confirmation of endemic opening failure
PM confirms new normal only in 3-6 months"

Stabilisation??

- The current trend is getting high from breaking record after record of more daily deaths, higher ICU, higher oxygen support, higher hospitalisation
numbers.
- ""Stabilisation""
continues these trends, if not let them worsen

Search the dictionary!
- ""Reflection"" Phase, ""Corrective"", ""Emergency"" etc. All fits reality much much closer

Not just a word
- Effectively, the name doesn't count
- But not when those highest up in the hierarchy always let investment in readiness fall short of necessary measures.
- Quit being sly by terming ""Stabilisation""
to buy insurance to own up to the responsibility expected from leadership

Make it your ""We'll stop fooling around with suicide"" Phase.
- by carrying out what MMTF claims it should be doing to keep transmission under control
- That and not more glib-tongue flip-flop talks"

2. Mobilize RC/PA/NC/CC volunteers and must pay them to help out at these tentages.
3. Dine in 2 or 5 for the VAX should be removed, this is not the time to enjoy food or lunch out there, just packet and leave the crowd. The VAX maybe the super spreader carrying all the virus back home to infect their elderly or children.
4. HBL for all the students including the tertiary levels.
5. Promptly update your new rulings at all housing notice boards.
6. Improve your hotline efficiency, so many numbers, so many abbreviations, so many changes becos your prediction are always wrong 🤡
7. Everyone can access to malls except those tested covid positive and they should be fined to moving around with the virus.

and not conclude that whiteys are purposely punishing the unvaccinated elderly. 54.7 is disproportionat
e? C’mon which idiot wrote this line? Send him for a statistics course. Disproportionat
e would be something way higher than 54.7% because the flip side 45.3% of vaccinated who are infected is very high basically says that the vaccine even if we have to punish them strategy did not work. The sentence structure basically is out to blame the unvaccinated while excusing the vaccinated. How lame is that? A good example of poor leaders blaming the poor easy to bully voiceless seniors."

All I wanna say is that... U don't really care about us

U allow tourists to move about freely on our own land while u implement restrictions on locals... So all this talk about keeping our citizens safe is in fact an attempt to keep the tourists safe... but at the expense of a big possiblity of bringing a new Delta Plus variant to Singapore"

Those who have not have made their peace with it and can suffer their fate. People die everyday, it's part of life. We are done taking care of them. What are you going to do when new variants pop up every year and we have to lock down each time cases go up. We need to open up!

Those who are afraid and praising this news, how about this, why don't you stay at home instead if you are so afraid. Let the rest of us go back to our normal lives."

I sincerely hope cases will start to go down but government should be more practical instead of being hopeful.

Having said that, one may ask… what is being practical? Right now tighten got good, got bad. Loosen got good, got bad. Timing is critical. Long term planning is very difficult, but it’s important to get it right. Unfortunately, very very few to no examples of countries opening but no covid cases. The lack of isolation bed is the foremost problem to solve.

Getting through this will require astute planning, got fire fighting, and lots of good fortune."

13369,10158186252057100,Such irony. We don't have adequate resources to support endemic and we want to open up and tell people to accept living with covi19. Its like telling people to move out of the kampong but you do not build enough flats for them to stay.
13370,10158186441642100,Say all this now than allow visitors from overseas !! full of rubbish 😏
13371,10158187986882100,"Now we have become the case study for failing to contain the virus in overseas channels. Complacency and failing to prepare the ground and people mentally were quoted as factors, but I would like to add the lack of enforcement and emphasis on safety measures are the cause. Too much attention and energy used to target the unvaccinated group that the crucial aspects were overlooked."
13372,10158186227522100,"By the way given the limited number of beds left, I would like to ask if a tourist were to be infected and a local citizen infected at the same time, who will be given the bed?? I am sure the million dollar paid ministers could have prepared and expected this when they open up so swiftly... 🤔"
13373,10158187240212100,"I think the taskforce has to acknowledge that cases are not going down because in general we are all tired and fatigue of the restrictions already even more so after the vaccinations rate achieved, there is not much change to our day to day life except we see that we have actively pursue VTL and This VTL probably only benefits those who have the money and time but not for the general public. In addition, the question why death is more prevelant compared to 3months ago still remains? What have other Europe countries such as denmark or Germany have done well such that they dont have on and off restrictions like in SG once the vaccination rate underway?"
13374,10158186251182100,"They will never open up if this is their rhetoric. As long as there are public outcries for tightening they will tighten up, doesn't matter if 100% are vaccinated. Just cannot afford to lose more votes."

13376,10158186238217100,Over 80% vaccination and claims by a certain minister to want to “live with covid”. What a joke. Not sure it’s news anymore that covid is highly transmissible and is extremely difficult to contain even with vaccination. This country’s government is one big fat JOKE

NOT OYK said we have to ride on major waves of transmissions, a rite of passage to achieve human-virus equilibrium; that's he and his MTF co-chairs' complacent thought out endemic roadmap without forethought and preparedness that catapult the daily 4-digits Covid-19 cases with ramifying consequences that see the premature deaths of seniors with underlying health conditions, healthcare system under pressure. Didn't OYK complacently say that the healthcare system can gear up to prepare for 10 Covid-19 cases."
13379,10158186296117100,"I'm surprised the govt's experts and advisers did not push upgrading/

Over the past 2 weeks, even after the announcement of vaccinated differentiation
, over 300 to 600 seniors of 61 and above continued to be infected and/or fall very sick every day! PREVENTION is better than cure - implement strong measures to “chase” them back inside their house!

13384,10158186219992100,They shouldn’t extend the measures! they should tighten them instead!!

13387,10158186254822100,Extension no use lah... Already can see no improvement. Should do more tightening or lock down better. Vaccination alr proved not effective to control the situation. Don't understand why not more measure are taken.

13397,10158186345482100,"Why was the past one month not used to work on building more isolation room? What’s required in an isolation room? Special equipment?? special medical attention?

Ultimately, people has to be responsible for themselves. If you know you are in the high risk group, then limit your own interaction.

People who are living with high risk group must also weigh their risk.

I still see the high risk group moving abt everywhere… it doesnt matter if it’s 2 or 5 or 10.

Primary sch students who are unvaccinated going to sch and eating together during meals.

If being vaccinated means having lower risk and able to recover at home, then why restrict?

Why must the govt babysit us???

I really cannot brain it… maybe I’m just too stupid."

13405,10158189242077100,POINTLESS!!!!! Even if extend till the next 2 to 3 years also no use. Lots of people are still enjoying leisure and eating out everyday. Everyday you can see shopping mall is packed with people come and go like nothing happen.
13406,10158186237067100,"Why not extend 2 months let everybody get used to endemic then mid point if case drops then can loosen instead extend every month?

Clearly the irrational measures don’t work. But take public transport can squeeze with each other because ventilation is good and the air inside the trains and the busses is healthy. If continue like this 6 months later still in stabilization phase. This is the pandemic of the vaccinated aka endemic."
13486,10158186520077100,Pls make vaccination compulsory. That’s the only effective way to reduce ICU cases and lighten up the health care stress. By implementing so much restriction and measure u r putting the whole Sg suffer.

They chit chat for long hours mask down over meals and drinks that already finished. They loitering around at malls and stores without buying anything. Better lockdown.

On the hand, you extend your stabilisation measures to control our movements in Singapore because of the continual covid spread. On the other hand, you open the VTLs for the reckless people to travel out of the country to places where their movements are not controlled at all. Hence, with the possibilities of them getting the virus, coming back sick to spread some more and further stress the healthcare facilities and workers. Your foreign visitors may also come in sick. Are you being fair to us who stay put here and probably be infected by all the travellers and will also need medical care? Something is terribly wrong here!"

Live with covid."
13600,10158186235822100,Just need to name another bombastic phase
13601,10158186235637100,"Amanda Ysq i told you already that you are very positive, as expected. 😆"
13602,10158186233957100,"It's already overload.
It's not the unvaccinated people.
Almost 97% of the eligible adults are already vaxx.
Left those mostly below 12 yrs old young children."
13603,10158186233747100,"I thought Ministers in September reassured us that they have enough resources, they even said they are ramping up the ICU beds and the medical resources such that they can handle 5k or even more cases daily. Now not even 4k already cannot tahan? They also keep saying light at the end of tunnel arriving soon.... https://

Last time CB also not as many daily cases as now.
Now daily cases atrocious yet continue with the same ridiculous measures.

13605,10158186229377100,Many short shortsighted here start to make nosie again hopeless look let us just lockdown forever and dont open up until five years later then open up ok?

13607,10158186222947100,Knowing PAP. This date is not set in stone. They will bring it forward the moment their wayang ART as the default and home recovery program help to bury more cases. But that will just delay the inevitable as more icu and serious cases emerges in the next wave.

13609,10158186221942100,"Not surprised.
The 1st stabilisation phase is a nice way to tell us it’s a failure. The 2nd extension is telling us it’s still is a failure.

Failure of endemic conditions precedent:
1. Rt value too high.
2. Number of discharge < daily infections
3. Infection rates increasing exponentially
4. Country ability to cope with virus not yet sufficient

Experts wrong. Decisions base on experts not correct so far

Implications
1. Economy more affected than July
2. More People continue getting covid
3. More Deaths

Likely reasons
Removal of tracking “linked” and “unlinked” cases and dependent only on vaccinations

Confirmation of endemic opening failure
PM confirms new normal only in 3-6 months"
13610,10158186220527100,We getting joked bruh
13611,10158186216842100,That goes my Diwali celebration.
13612,10158186215552100,Trying very hard to push that all singaporeans get infected and finally admitted that healthcare has been overwhelmed.
13613,10158186213932100,"Omg. This is real bad. And really bad foresight and estimation. So if all the beds are filled, where are we going to place more patients and etc. And yet they gonna open more VTL lanes in the coming months. I presume MTF knows that we have yet to reach the peak and we have yet reached our worst period. Everyone please stay vigilant now and we are on our own."
13614,10158186213787100,"Endemic ma, didnt they know this?"
13615,10158186211122100,"If healthcare system is overstretched, why you still open more VTL so contradictory?

Do you hv enough hospital beds for the imports ?

Please spare a thought for our healthcare workers, we already hv enough problems.
